# Named-Entity Recognition with Structured Perceptrons

Structured Perceptrons --> Classification with lots of features over structured models!

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Relation Extraction is the task of identifying & classifying the semantic relations between entities in text. The relation extraction task can be treated as a sequence labelling problem & the performance of BIO & IO encoding schemes can be analyzed considering the conditional random field. The relation extraction task is treated as a structured sequence labelling problem where the application of the *Conditional Random Field* is most suitable.

Directly run hw5-structuredLearnings.py file in the same folder as that of ‘stories’ zip files and create a dev folder to store intermediate files.

OR

In order to run the .ipynb file, just run the command ‘jupiter notebook hw5-structuredLearnings.ipynb', which will open ipython notebook.

To RUN THE NOTEBOOK, go to cell and click on 'RUN ALL' which will run all the methods in the file.

Please place the .ipynb file in the same folder with that of ‘stories’ zip files and create a folder called dev to store intermediate files.

Also attached is the python file hw5-structuredLearnings.py generated from iPython notebook.

For the second part autoencoder.py is attached which has the information on the GRU cell. 

And autoencoder_rnnEncoder.py having RNN cell instead of BOW encoder.
