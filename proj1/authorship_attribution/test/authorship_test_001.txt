`` Do you do anything yourself ? ''
Mr. Denham had recovered his self-control ; he spoke with a quietness which made Katharine rather anxious that he should explain himself , but at the same time she wished to annoy him , to waft him away from her on some light current of ridicule or satire , as she was wont to do with these intermittent young men of her father 's .
`` You see '' -- she tapped the volume of her grandfather 's poems -- '' we don't even print as well as they did , and as for poets or painters or novelists -- there are none ; so , at any rate , I 'm not singular . ''
Ralph made a sound which belittled this particular argument .
It was plain to Joan that she had struck one of her brother 's perverse moods , and he was going to oppose whatever his mother said .
She sighed involuntarily , and the sigh annoyed Ralph , and he exclaimed with irritation :
`` D'you ever pay calls now ? ''
The Alardyces , the Hilberys , the Millingtons , and the Otways seem to prove that intellect is a possession which can be tossed from one member of a certain group to another almost indefinitely , and with apparent certainty that the brilliant gift will be safely caught and held by nine out of ten of the privileged race .
Whatever profession you looked at , there was a Warburton or an Alardyce , a Millington or a Hilbery somewhere in authority and prominence .
`` Well done , Katharine !
But , as you say , the great thing is to finish the book .
he said , as if he were pleasantly surprised by that fact .
One person after another rose , and , as with an ill-balanced axe , attempted to hew out his conception of art a little more clearly , and sat down with the feeling that , for some reason which he could not grasp , his strokes had gone awry .
Before long , therefore , the groups on the mattresses and the groups on the chairs were all in communication with each other , and Mary Datchet , who had begun to darn stockings again , stooped down and remarked to Ralph :
Mary was struck by her capacity for being thus easily silent , and occupied with her own thoughts .
You were laughing because you thought I 'd changed the conversation ? ''
His voice showed that the question was one that had been prepared .
`` I know how to find the Pole star if I 'm lost . ''
The night was very still , and on such nights , when the traffic thins away , the walker becomes conscious of the moon in the street , as if the curtains of the sky had been drawn apart , and the heaven lay bare , as it does in the country .
The air was softly cool , so that people who had been sitting talking in a crowd found it pleasant to walk a little before deciding to stop an omnibus or encounter light again in an underground railway .
Sandys , who was a barrister with a philosophic tendency , took out his pipe , lit it , murmured `` hum '' and `` ha , '' and was silent .
At the Strand he supposed that they would separate , but instead they crossed the road , and took their way down one of the narrow passages which lead through ancient courts to the river .
Yes , she did very well to dream about -- but Sandys had suddenly begun to talk .
He was a solitary man who had made his friends at college and always addressed them as if they were still undergraduates arguing in his room , though many months or even years had passed in some cases between the last sentence and the present one .
The method was a little singular , but very restful , for it seemed to ignore completely all accidents of human life , and to span very deep abysses with a few simple words .
Rodney cried , striking his hand once more upon the balustrade , `` why ca n't one say how beautiful it all is ?
Why am I condemned for ever , Katharine , to feel what I ca n't express ?
And the things I can give there 's no use in my giving .
I should n't bother you to marry me then , Katharine . ''
`` Do n't let the man see us struggling , for God 's sake ! ''
He looked back after the cab twice , suspiciously , half expecting that she would stop it and dismount ; but it bore her swiftly on , and was soon out of sight .
`` But I dare say it 's just as well that you have to earn your own living . ''
They sat silent , and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably in a blue vapor above their heads .
She was , indeed , rather annoyed with herself for having allowed such an ill-considered breach of her reserve , weakening her powers of resistance , she felt , should this impulse return again .
She did not want to marry at all .
It seemed to her that there was something amateurish in bringing love into touch with a perfectly straightforward friendship , such as hers was with Ralph , which , for two years now , had based itself upon common interests in impersonal topics , such as the housing of the poor , or the taxation of land values .
About four o'clock on that same afternoon Katharine Hilbery was walking up Kingsway .
At the same time she wished to talk .
Mrs. Seal looked for a moment as though she could hardly believe her ears , and made a deprecating `` tut-tut-tut '' in her throat , looking alternately at Katharine and Mary , and shaking her head as she did so .
Then she remarked , rather confidentially to Katharine , with a little nod in Mary 's direction :
Mary interposed , rather sharply .
`` We 're not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge in the same house with us . ''
Have you seen this week 's `` Punch , '' Miss Datchet ? ''
ran to open the door .
Ralph , Katharine supposed , was a frequent visitor , for the only person he thought it necessary to greet was herself , and Mary at once explained the strange fact of her being there by saying :
She walked very fast , and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was to produce a queer dizziness both in her head and in Ralph 's , which set their bodies far apart .
But she did her duty by her companion almost unconsciously .
`` I 'm not sorry that I was out , '' said Katharine .
`` They have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell Square .
he speculated at last , rather to himself than to her .
Left alone , Katharine could not help laughing to find herself cheated as usual in domestic bargainings with her father , and left to do the disagreeable work which belonged , by rights , to him .
Katharine tried to interrupt this discourse , but the opportunity did not come , and she could not forbear to turn over the pages of the album in which the old photographs were stored .
Some were of almost incredible beauty , others were ugly enough in a forcible way , but none were dull or bored or insignificant .
Once more Katharine felt the serene air all round her , and seemed far off to hear the solemn beating of the sea upon the shore .
How we all bowed down before you !
And it was true ; she brought them together , you know .
She said to my father , 'Marry her , ' and he did ; and she said to poor little Clara , 'Fall down and worship him , ' and she did ; but she got up again , of course .
What else could one expect ?
`` I think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril , mother , '' she said rather brutally .
`` Aunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married .
`` We must realize Cyril 's point of view first , '' she said , speaking directly to her mother , as if to a contemporary , but before the words were out of her mouth , there was more confusion outside , and Cousin Caroline , Mrs. Hilbery 's maiden cousin , entered the room .
`` This unhappy business , '' she began , out of breath as she was .
You will agree with me , Maggie .
He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the children -- ''
She was much disappointed in her mother -- and in herself too .
She was very angry , and yet impotent to give expression to her anger , or know with whom she was angry .
She stood there , thinking of her own destiny , and the elder ladies talked on , until they had talked themselves into a decision to ask the young woman to luncheon , and tell her , very friendlily , how such behavior appeared to women like themselves , who knew the world .
And then she thought to herself , `` I 'm behaving exactly as I said I would n't behave , '' whereupon she relaxed all her muscles and said , in her reasonable way :
But I trust you where feeling is concerned .
I always think of you when I 'm writing , Katharine , even when it 's the sort of thing you would n't know about .
But my little self-control had its reward , for next moment she tapped at the door and came in , and sat on the rug , and though we neither of us said anything , I felt so happy all of a second that I could n't help crying , 'Oh , Katharine , when you come to my age , how I hope you 'll have a daughter , too ! '
You know how silent Katharine is .
She was so silent , for such a long time , that in my foolish , nervous state I dreaded something , I do n't quite know what .
But why , when everything 's turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out , why then can one do nothing but cry , nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life 's been a failure , and now is nearly over , and age is so cruel ?
But Katharine said to me , 'I am happy .
She told me that they would live quite near us , and see us every day ; and she would go on with the Life , and we should finish it as we had meant to .
He made some show of considering the matter , and was taken upstairs to the drawing-room .
But this time Katharine was there by herself ; the volume in her hand showed that she expected no visitors .
`` Is that one of the moderns whom you despise ? ''
Ralph held the door open for her , and then stood with clasped hands in the middle of the room .
All down the street and on the doorstep , and while he mounted the stairs , his dream of Katharine possessed him ; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it , in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her and what she was .
`` But I do read De Quincey , '' Ralph protested , `` more than Belloc and Chesterton , anyhow . ''
But he will get his knighthood and a pension , I believe , '' she said , turning to Ralph , `` only it is not England . ''
Mrs. Cosham approved of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity from her side of the tea-table , in the first place by swaying her head , and in the second by remarking :
Such eyes she had , Mr. Denham !
And they had a nurse in those days , '' she went on , telling her story with charming solemnity to Ralph , `` who was a good woman , but engaged to a sailor .
Ralph remained standing with his hand on the back of a chair in absolute silence .
Abysses seemed to plunge into darkness between them .
`` And , besides , that sort of thing 's not in my line , '' he added , rather grimly .
She had meant to ask him why it is that the sparrows in Lincoln 's Inn Fields are tamer than the sparrows in Hyde Park -- perhaps it is that the passers-by are rarer , and they come to recognize their benefactors .
For the first half-hour of the committee meeting , Mary had thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of Ralph Denham , who threatened to have it all his own way .
To her annoyance , her pencil drew a little round figure on the blotting-paper , which , she could not deny , was really a bald-headed cock-sparrow .
with something ludicrously grotesque about them , which might , at any moment , provoke her to such flippancy as would shock her colleagues for ever .
But all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to the surface by a more profound disturbance , which , as she could not consider it at present , manifested its existence by these grotesque nods and beckonings .
Meanwhile , she was behaving scandalously ; she was looking out of the window , and thinking of the color of the sky , and of the decorations on the Imperial Hotel , when she ought to have been shepherding her colleagues , and pinning them down to the matter in hand .
Once more , she knew exactly and indisputably what is right and what is wrong .
`` What do I matter compared with the cause ? ''
Much to her credit , however teased by foolish fancies , she kept the surface of her brain moderate and vigilant , and subdued Mrs. Seal very tactfully more than once when she demanded , `` Action !
`` Let 's have our tea , '' she said , turning back from the window and pulling down the blind .
she let fall , casually , as she sat down at the table .
`` You can afford to laugh , '' said Sally , with another shake of her head , `` but I ca n't .
I 'm fifty-five , and I dare say I shall be in my grave by the time we get it -- if we ever do . ''
She leant back in her chair , and the smoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her still further from the others .
`` What in the world are they after ? ''
`` How do I find the time ? ''
And I ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning .
And then I meet men , and talk to them .
There 's a man in my office who knows all about the Flemish school .
I was telling Miss Datchet about the Flemish school .
The village of Disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of cultivated ground in the neighborhood of Lincoln , not so far inland but that a sound , bringing rumors of the sea , can be heard on summer nights or when the winter storms fling the waves upon the long beach .
So great a trust in the Church can surely not belong to our day , and he goes on to conjecture that every one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human life .
But the light of the late afternoon glowed green behind the straight trees , and became a symbol of her .
`` The cottage I 'm thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard . ''
`` Well , what 's the date of the wedding ? ''
From the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke , Henry thought that some sort of explosion on Rodney 's part was about to take place .
I do n't hunt myself .
You have a great reputation as a horseman , anyhow , '' he added , desiring to help Rodney in his effort to recover his complacency .
Rodney had completely dropped his pose as a man of the world , and seemed to be asking Henry to help him in a difficulty .
`` D'you think children -- a household -- that sort of thing -- d'you think that 'll satisfy her ?
`` Oh , she 's wonderfully competent , '' said Rodney .
She had always trusted her , and now more than ever , since her engagement to Rodney , which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable , and just what one would wish for one 's own daughter .
`` Yes , '' she continued , glancing at Katharine , with the round , greenish eyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles , `` Katharine is like the girls of my youth .
`` Oh , but marriage is the happiest life for a woman , '' said Mrs. Hilbery , catching the word marriage , as she brought her eyes back to the room again .
She took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and round , but she did not know what to say next .
`` I tell you , Mary , it 's utter destruction , working away , day after day , at stuff that does n't matter a damn to any one .
He paused again , but felt that this , at any rate , was true , and that on these lines he could go on .
`` I think I do , '' she said .
`` It 's true I do n't want you to go to America , '' he said , looking fixedly at the table-cloth .
`` If she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh at me I could n't have felt that about her , '' he thought .
I ca n't have been utterly mistaken all these years .
The truth of it is , '' he thought , `` that I've got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me like that .
How can I change myself ?
He was terribly tempted here to break the silence by asking Katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit her ; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of his gifts and acquirements , his knowledge of Greek and Latin , his knowledge of art and literature , his skill in the management of meters , and his ancient west-country blood .
But the feeling that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the certainty that he loved Katharine as sincerely as he had it in him to love any one .
I might have loved Mary if it had n't been for that idiocy of mine .
She cared for me once , I 'm certain of that , but I tormented her so with my humors that I let my chances slip , and now she wo n't risk marrying me .
The tramp of their boots upon the dry road seemed to asseverate nothing , nothing , nothing .
She could not blame him for loving Katharine , but that , when he loved another , he should ask her to marry him -- that seemed to her the cruellest treachery .
She tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself that morning , as Ralph paid the bill for luncheon ; but she could see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase .
`` I doubt that one human being ever understands another , '' he said , stopping in his march and confronting Mary at a distance of a few feet .
She half held a vision ; the vision shaped and dwindled .
Already her suffering as an individual was left behind her .
She could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument of justice -- the typewriter .
When she returned , with a message from the printer , she found that Mary was putting on her hat firmly ; there was something imperious and dominating in her attitude altogether .
`` I 've not seen him since Christmas . ''
After all , she considered , why should she speak ?
It asked too much of one already stripped bare .
Immediately she figured an immured life , continuing for an immense period , the same feelings living for ever , neither dwindling nor changing within the ring of a thick stone wall .
I do n't want to be jealous of you .
And I am -- I 'm fearfully jealous .
He recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose , long like all the Otway noses , seemed to extend itself into the flute , as if she were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole .
The little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament .
The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to William , and suggested a thousand ways in which , with his training and accomplishments , he could be of service to her .
Meanwhile , as Katharine was certain to be late , and `` The Magic Flute '' is nothing without a voice , he felt inclined to spend the time of waiting in writing a letter to Cassandra , exhorting her to read Pope in preference to Dostoevsky , until her feeling for form was more highly developed .
He set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light and playful , and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near at heart , when he heard Katharine upon the stairs .
His temper had changed from one of urbane contentment -- indeed of delicious expansion -- to one of uneasiness and expectation .
It was now a quarter of an hour beyond the specified time .
He bethought him of a piece of news which had depressed him in the earlier part of the day .
Such things had happened less frequently since Christmas , but what if they were going to begin to happen again ?
What if their marriage should turn out , as she had said , a farce ?
`` That wo n't make any difference , will it ?
He told her , in an off-hand way , how one of his fellow-clerks had broken down , and might have to be away for months , six months even , in which case they would have to think over their position .
There was no outward sign that he was annoyed with her .
She thought sufficiently so .
She looked for a clock .
As their eyes met , she realized for the first time that she was talking to Ralph Denham , and she remembered , without recalling any details , that she had been speaking of him quite lately , and that she had reason to think ill of him .
What Mary had said she could not remember , but she felt that there was a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time to examine -- knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf .
He was telling her that he had taken a cottage in Norfolk , and she was saying that she knew , or did not know , that particular neighborhood .
But after a moment 's attention her mind flew to Rodney , and she had an unusual , indeed unprecedented , sense that they were in touch and shared each other 's thoughts .
`` But what will you find to do in the country ? ''
He at once forgot to listen to what they were saying , although he interposed nervously at intervals , `` Yes , yes , yes . ''
As the minutes passed , Ralph 's presence became more and more intolerable to him , since there was so much that he must say to Katharine ; the moment he could not talk to her , terrible doubts , unanswerable questions accumulated , which he must lay before Katharine , for she alone could help him now .
Unless he could see her alone , it would be impossible for him ever to sleep , or to know what he had said in a moment of madness , which was not altogether mad , or was it mad ?
There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there .
His only chance , then , of saying something to her in private , was to take her downstairs and walk with her to the street .
While he hesitated , however , overcome with the difficulty of putting one simple thought into words when all his thoughts were scattered about , and all were too strong for utterance , he was struck silent by something that was still more unexpected .
Aware of her preoccupation , or absorbed in his own thoughts , Ralph said nothing further ; and in silence they walked some distance along the Strand .
Ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order that one came before the rest , and the determination that when he spoke he should speak worthily , made him put off the moment of speaking till he had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him .
Without a word of explanation he turned to the left , down one of the side streets leading to the river .
On no account must they part until something of the very greatest importance had happened .
Now , however , that he was alone with her , not only did he find the difficulty of speaking almost insurmountable , but he was aware that he was angry with her for thus disturbing him , and casting , as it was so easy for a person of her advantages to do , these phantoms and pitfalls across his path .
He was determined that he would question her as severely as he would question himself ; and make them both , once and for all , either justify her dominance or renounce it .
Her skirt blew ; the feathers in her hat waved ; sometimes he saw her a step or two ahead of him , or had to wait for her to catch him up .
First she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from his company ; then she recalled vaguely something that Mary had said to make her think ill of him ; she could not remember what , but the recollection , combined with his masterful ways -- why did he walk so fast down this side street ?
-- made her more and more conscious of a person of marked , though disagreeable , force by her side .
He was thus precipitated into speech .
He turned his head towards her .
She recovered the words she was searching for while he spoke .
Her anger blazed up in her .
`` I will write , '' she said vaguely .
Then , perceiving her daughter 's expression of perplexity , Mrs. Hilbery burst out laughing .
It happened that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere , so that the task of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell upon Katharine .
When , however , she was fairly out of doors , and constantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats , she forbore .
The longer she held the letter in her hand , however , the more persistently certain questions pressed upon her , as if from a collection of voices in the air .
Was it right , they asked , to invite Cassandra for a visit , and was William Rodney in love with her , or likely to fall in love ?
What does honor require you to do ?
he exclaimed passionately , but withdrew his hand and turned his back .
`` Yes , we should both be free .
Let us say that I saw Cassandra once , twice , perhaps , under these conditions ; and then if , as I think certain , the whole thing proves a dream , we tell your mother instantly .
You 'll mind too much . ''
The greenery and the high presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at her coming .
`` Do n't you see that if you have no relations with people it 's easier to be honest with them ? ''
`` That is what I meant .
Denham was agreed with her as to the destructiveness of the family system , but he did not wish to discuss the problem at that moment .
`` At least , on both sides it must be understood that if either chooses to fall in love , he or she does so entirely at his own risk .
They must be at liberty to break or to alter at any moment .
Whose name , what book , which life was changed Katharine proceeded to ascertain .
She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly , for she was very late .
`` Can you make her out ? ''
Mr. Basnett , a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the hair was combed straight back , was one of that group of `` very able young men '' suspected by Mr. Clacton , justly as it turned out , of an influence upon Mary Datchet .
The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary , and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to Mary , and make her an offer of the Secretaryship , to which , as a matter of principle , a small salary was attached .
Since seven o'clock that evening he had been reading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded , but the reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion , and it was so often necessary to inform Mary `` in strictest confidence '' of the private characters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that they were still only half-way through the manuscript .
In their absorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire , and yet both Mr. Basnett in his exposition , and Mary in her interrogation , carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion .
Against her wish , Mary insisted upon taking her downstairs , and then , as there was no cab to be seen , they stood in the street together , looking about them .
`` Nonsense , Mary , '' said Katharine , rather distractedly , taking her arm and beginning to walk up the street in the direction of the main road .
`` Let me see ; we went to Kew , and we agreed to be friends .
Yes , that's what happened . ''
Mary was silent , in the hope that Katharine would tell her more .
But Katharine said nothing .
`` No , no , it 's not worth it , '' Katharine repeated .
Still , '' she added , `` I believe you exaggerate ; love's not everything ; marriage itself is only one of the things -- '' They had reached the main thoroughfare , and stood looking at the omnibuses and passers-by , who seemed , for the moment , to illustrate what Katharine had said of the diversity of human interests .
`` Stop me if you want anything explained . ''
`` What do you read in bed , Katharine ? ''
`` Queer , but very fascinating .
I shall read Milton to-night .
It 's been one of the happiest nights of my life , Katharine , '' she added , looking with shy devotion at her cousin 's beautiful face .
`` I must warn you to expect a family party , '' said Ralph .
While Ralph took off his coat , she had time to notice the ferns and photographs and draperies , and to hear a hum , or rather a babble , of voices talking each other down , from the sound of them .
She kept as far behind Denham as she could , and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded lights , which fell upon a number of people , of different ages , sitting round a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food , and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas .
-- standing in the wet playing football .
`` Yes , indeed , we find it very healthy , '' she said , and she went on , as people who live in the suburbs so often do , to prove that it was healthier , more convenient , and less spoilt than any suburb round London .
Johnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry -- ''
For some time they continued the argument , and then the intervals between one statement and the next became longer and longer , and they spoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously , and at last fell silent .
`` This is what I foretold .
`` If such gain 's worth having . ''
It may be true .
I 've known one or two cases where it seems to be true . ''
He hoped that she would go on with the subject .
He had done his best to master himself , and his voice was sufficiently indifferent , but her silence tormented him .
`` But I 'm in love with you ! ''
He leant against the window-sill , looking over the city as she had looked .
Shutting the book of Greek photographs , and hiding his relics , he ran downstairs , snatched his coat , and passed out of doors .
The lamps were being lit , but the streets were dark enough and empty enough to let him walk his fastest , and to talk aloud as he walked .
He was going to find Mary Datchet .
He was soon in her street .
He ran up the stairs leading to her flat two steps at a time , and it never crossed his mind that she might not be at home .
`` You 'll stay and dine ? ''
she said casually , returning to her seat .
she asked gently , and even with courtesy , at length .
Had Rodney spoken those words ?
You 're not in love with him !
`` I 've something that I want to say to you in PRIVATE , '' she said , hesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush .
You forgive me for saying what I 'd much rather not say ?
What I say is only for your own sake , my child . ''
`` People are saying that William goes everywhere with you and Cassandra , and that he is always paying her attentions .
At the Zoo they were seen alone together .
At these words Mrs. Milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive ; she glanced at her niece 's face , but read no pity there , whereupon she folded her hands upon a black velvet bag which she carried in an attitude that was almost one of prayer .
I beg you to forget my insanity , Katharine . ''
`` Mrs. Milvain is not tactful , I know , but you exaggerate , Katharine .
She sank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap .
She raised herself and repeated the sentence yet a third time .
`` I 've never admired anybody more , '' William interposed .
`` Have I never understood you , Katharine ?
Cassandra ratified this conclusion so far as she was concerned , and William , after receiving the exquisite pleasure of her glance , with its absolute affection and trust , looked anxiously at Katharine .
`` If he chooses to come -- '' she said defiantly .
`` It was worth it .
I heard you call me . ''
`` As far as I understand you -- but what should you advise me to do with this ring ? ''
`` To the same man ? ''
William never tried to educate me . ''
As she spoke she saw the light fade from Cassandra 's face , as if she had implied some other , more mysterious , relationship .
She could never compete with Katharine ; she could never be safe so long as Katharine brooded over her , dominating her , disposing of her .
She called her cold , unseeing , unscrupulous , but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious one -- she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history .
`` Was that him ? ''
`` I meant Ralph Denham . ''
The accusation that Katharine was calm , callous , and indifferent was not possible in face of her present air of animation .
She gave Cassandra no time to frame an answer .
`` ... a thousand pities -- ahem -- I fear we shall cause a great deal of natural annoyance .
If , on the other hand , what I have reason to think will happen , should happen -- within reasonable time , and the present position is not in any way offensive to you , delay would , in my opinion , serve all our interests better than a premature explanation , which is bound to cause more surprise than is desirable -- ''
`` I 'm Ralph Denham speaking .
`` I shall come . ''
A long pause followed .
Ralph began a sentence , which he canceled with the word , `` Nothing . ''
In truth , now that her mother was away , Katharine did feel less sensible than usual , but as she argued it to herself , there was much less need for sense .
She was , for example , walking down a road in Northumberland in the August sunset ; at the inn she left her companion , who was Ralph Denham , and was transported , not so much by her own feet as by some invisible means , to the top of a high hill .
Here the scents , the sounds among the dry heather-roots , the grass-blades pressed upon the palm of her hand , were all so perceptible that she could experience each one separately .
It appealed to his chivalry .
By the time the cake was eaten and the tea drunk the personal question had lapsed , and they were discussing poetry .
Insensibly they turned from the question of dramatic poetry in general , to the particular example which reposed in William 's pocket , and when the maid came in to clear away the tea-things , William had asked permission to read a short passage aloud , `` unless it bored her ? ''
Very pale , and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon Mary as upon vistas of unresponding blankness , Katharine addressed herself also not so much to Mary as to the unrelenting spirit which now appeared to mock her from every quarter of her survey .
`` I really do n't know . ''
Slackly lying back in her armchair , she watched the little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently , as if they , too , were very distant and indifferent .
`` I 'll wait another half-hour . ''
`` Mr. Denham called again , miss .
He has been waiting for you for some time . ''
William , when he came in late that afternoon and found Cassandra alone , had a very serious piece of news to impart .
He had just passed Katharine in the street and she had failed to recognize him .
The performance came to an end , the illusion dying out first here and then there , as some rose to put on their coats , others stood upright to salute `` God Save the King , '' the musicians folded their music and encased their instruments , and the lights sank one by one until the house was empty , silent , and full of great shadows .
Katharine did not reply at once , and Mr. Hilbery tapped the coal encouragingly with the poker .
Then she said , without embarrassment or apology :
We agree perfectly . ''
Take my word for it , most people go through this sort of thing when they 're engaged .
I 've seen more trouble come from long engagements than from any other form of human folly .
Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your minds -- both of you .
While Cassandra accepted his invitation , Rodney remained standing .
`` You 've come back ? ''
said Katharine , very vaguely , standing up to receive the embrace .
But by means of these furtive glances she had assured herself that Katharine was in a state which gave her , alternately , the most exquisite pleasure and the most profound alarm .
He tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping up the partitions of the mind , until he could decently go home ; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently , as if from outside , by Katharine , that he launched forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her .
She obliterated a bookcase full of law reports , and the corners and lines of the room underwent a curious softening of outline like that which sometimes makes a room unfamiliar at the moment of waking from sleep .
Her remark was entirely destructive of poetry , since it was to the effect that poetry had nothing whatever to do with her ; all her friends spent their lives in making up phrases , she said ; all his feeling was an illusion , and next moment , as if to taunt him with his impotence , she had sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no account whatever of his existence .
Ralph was roused by his passionate attempts to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing in the middle of his little private room in Lincoln 's Inn Fields at a considerable distance from Chelsea .
She stopped the carriage at post-offices , and coffee-shops , and shops of inscrutable dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends ; and , catching sight of the dome of St. Paul 's above the irregular spires of Ludgate Hill , she pulled the cord impulsively , and gave directions that Anderson should drive them there .
But Anderson had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship , and kept his horse 's nose obstinately towards the west .
Mr. Hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet .
He nodded with some degree of stiffness to Rodney and Denham , who had both risen upon seeing him , and now altogether sat down .
`` You regret nothing -- ''
He crossed the road immediately , and went up the steps into Mary's house .
It signaled to her across the dark street ; it was a sign of triumph shining there for ever , not to be extinguished this side of the grave .
she thought , and all the darkness of London seemed set with fires , roaring upwards ; but her eyes came back to Mary 's window and rested there satisfied .
She had waited some time before a figure detached itself from the doorway and came across the road , slowly and reluctantly , to where she stood .
She might speak to him , but with that strange tremor in his voice , those eyes blindly adoring , whom did he answer ?
And where was she walking , and who was her companion ?
They turned and found themselves opposite the house .
Quietly they surveyed the friendly place , burning its lamps either in expectation of them or because Rodney was still there talking to Cassandra .
Katharine pushed the door half open and stood upon the threshold .
The light lay in soft golden grains upon the deep obscurity of the hushed and sleeping household .
For a moment they waited , and then loosed their hands .
`` Good night , '' she murmured back to him .
I do n't know what it was in the look of her that so moved me ; but I could not restrain myself , and , dashing across the room , I clasped her in my arms .
`` How happy you look ! ''
Whereupon she told me the whole of her story .
`` Before you say any more , I want to know -- am I to stay in the room ?
Everyone looked at her in astonishment .
`` Of course we wish to bear children ! ''
cried Castalia , impatiently .
`` Surely you could teach her to believe that a man 's intellect is , and always will be , fundamentally superior to a woman 's ? ''
She brightened at this and began to turn over our old minutes again .
`` Yes , '' she said , `` think of their discoveries , their mathematics , their science , their philosophy , their scholarship -- -- '' and then she began to laugh , `` I shall never forget old Hobkin and the hairpin , '' she said , and went on reading and laughing and I thought she was quite happy , when suddenly she drew the book from her and burst out , `` Oh , Cassandra , why do you torment me ?
`` As if I doubted it , '' she said scornfully .
`` We insisted upon having intellect and now we 've got it .
What could be more charming than a boy before he has begun to cultivate his intellect ?
He maintains a whole family by the products of his brain -- poor devil !
That we shall be able in ten years ' time to spend a week-end at Lahore ?
But other human beings forbade intercourse .
This done , I glanced up quickly , armed with a shield of my own .
[ But this we 'll skip ; ornaments , curtains , trefoil china plate , yellow oblongs of cheese , white squares of biscuit -- skip -- oh , but wait !
Halfway through luncheon one of those shivers ; Bob stares at her , spoon in mouth .
You shake it ; it 's the pearl stud there was last year -- that 's all .
( Let me peep across at her opposite ; she 's asleep or pretending it ; so what would she think about sitting at the window at three o'clock in the afternoon ?
Health , money , hills , her God ? )
More like President Kruger than Prince Albert -- that 's the best I can do for him ; and I see him on a chair , in a black frock-coat , not so very high up either ; I can manage a cloud or two for him to sit on ; and then his hand trailing in the cloud holds a rod , a truncheon is it ?
-- black , thick , thorned -- a brutal old bully -- Minnie 's God !
Did he send the itch and the patch and the twitch ?
Whether you did , or what you did , I do n't mind ; it 's not the thing I want .
The draper 's window looped with violet -- that 'll do ; a little cheap perhaps , a little commonplace -- since one has a choice of crimes , but then so many ( let me peep across again -- still sleeping , or pretending sleep !
It's raised , it 's red , it 's burning .
How you hate her !
Is there no one here who thinks of God ?
Do they catch them ?
So she reaches home -- scrapes her boots .
`` The fronds of the aspidistra only partly concealed the commercial traveller -- '' Rhododendrons would conceal him utterly , and into the bargain give me my fling of red and white , for which I starve and strive ; but rhododendrons in Eastbourne -- in December -- on the Marshes ' table -- no , no , I dare not ; it 's all a matter of crusts and cruets , frills and ferns .
Perhaps there 'll be a moment later by the sea .
[ Minnie , you must promise not to twitch till I've got this straight ] .
-- but the time 's not come for bringing _them_ in -- the big and the little on the long cards , some peacock-eyed , others dull gold ; cairngorms some , and others coral sprays -- but I say the time 's not come .
Roses -- and his wife a retired hospital nurse -- interesting -- for God 's sake let me have one woman with a name I like !
It's life 's fault .
There must be Moggridge -- life 's fault .
Life imposes her laws ; life blocks the way ; life 's behind the fern ; life 's the tyrant ; oh , but not the bully !
Behind the aspidistra they see something : black , white , dismal ; now the plate again ; behind the aspidistra they see elderly woman ; `` Marsh 's sister , Hilda 's more my sort ; '' the tablecloth now .
God 's truth , what's set her twitching ?
Well , but I 'm confounded ... .
Surely , Minnie , you know better !
I 'll tell him -- Minnie !
There 's something queer in her cloak as it blows .
Oh , but it's untrue , it 's indecent ... .
Look how he bends as they reach the gateway .
She finds her ticket .
What 's the joke ?
What do I stand on ?
That 's not Minnie .
There never was Moggridge .
`` But I knew you at once ! ''
Woven together , like reeds in moonlight .
Woven together , inextricably commingled , bound in pain and strewn in sorrow -- crash !
The swan pushes from the bank and floats dreaming into mid stream .
He talked almost incessantly ; he smiled to himself and again began to talk , as if the smile had been an answer .
He was talking about spirits -- the spirits of the dead , who , according to him , were even now telling him all sorts of odd things about their experiences in Heaven .
It may even be caused by some round black substance , such as a small rose leaf , left over from the summer , and I , not being a very vigilant housekeeper -- look at the dust on the mantelpiece , for example , the dust which , so they say , buried Troy three times over , only fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation , as one can believe .
`` Think of the lovely , lovely birds settling down on their nests .
Now turn and shut your eyes , '' she murmured , `` and shut your eyes . ''
`` I thought he 'd never get off -- such a hurricane , '' she whispered to Rebecca , who was bending over a spirit-lamp in the small room next door .
Mr. Pearce had extinguished the lamp .
The garden went out .
It was but a dark patch .
Every blade of grass was bent by rain .
Eyelids would have been fastened down by the rain .
Morris called it `` an extremely local insect found in damp or marshy places . ''
Sometimes Jacob , choosing a very fine pen , made a correction in the margin .
There he stood pale , come out of the depths of darkness , in the hot room , blinking at the light .
She was going to walk on the moor .
Had she again been pacing her lawn late at night ?
Had she again tapped on the study window and cried : `` Look at the moon , look at the moon , Herbert ! ''
Captain Barfoot sat him down in the arm-chair to wait .
Resting his elbows on the arms , putting one hand over the other , sticking his lame leg straight out , and placing the stick with the rubber ferrule beside it , he sat perfectly still .
There was something rigid about him .
But were they `` nice '' thoughts , interesting thoughts ?
He was a man with a temper ; tenacious , faithful .
Women would have felt , `` Here is law .
But Betty Flanders thought nothing of the kind .
Little windows , and the lilac and green of the garden were reflected in her eyes .
`` Then you will stand for the Council ? ''
The lips were shut .
All was firm , yet youthful , indifferent , unconscious -- as for knocking one down !
Every time he lunches out on Sunday -- at dinner parties and tea parties -- there will be this same shock -- horror -- discomfort -- then pleasure , for he draws into him at every step as he walks by the river such steady certainty , such reassurance from all sides , the trees bowing , the grey spires soft in the blue , voices blowing and seeming suspended in the air , the springy air of May , the elastic air with its particles -- chestnut bloom , pollen , whatever it is that gives the May air its potency , blurring the trees , gumming the buds , daubing the green .
If any light burns above Cambridge , it must be from three such rooms ; Greek burns here ; science there ; philosophy on the ground floor .
Now , as his eye goes down the print , what a procession tramps through the corridors of his brain , orderly , quick-stepping , and reinforced , as the march goes on , by fresh runnels , till the whole hall , dome , whatever one calls it , is populous with ideas .
Strange paralysis and constriction -- marvellous illumination .
Meanwhile behind him the shape they had made , whether by argument or not , the spiritual shape , hard yet ephemeral , as of glass compared with the dark stone of the Chapel , was dashed to splinters , young men rising from chairs and sofa corners , buzzing and barging about the room , one driving another against the bedroom door , which giving way , in they fell .
Then Jacob was left there , in the shallow arm-chair , alone with Masham ?
Some people can follow every step of the way , and even take a little one , six inches long , by themselves at the end ; others remain observant of the external signs .
Indeed , it was such a fine day that there was no saying what a pair of field-glasses might not have fetched into view .
`` I say the conditions were fulfilled .
`` Oh dear , '' said Mrs. Durrant .
`` Let ME look , '' said Charlotte eagerly .
`` Sit THERE , '' she said .
`` Poor Jacob , '' said Mrs. Durrant , quietly , as if she had known him all his life .
`` They 're going to make you act in their play . ''
Yet few took advantage of it .
The October sunlight rested upon all these men and women sitting immobile ; and little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase , carrying his large mysterious parcel , and so dodging a zigzag course between the wheels he reached the pavement , started to whistle a tune and was soon out of sight -- for ever .
The omnibuses jerked on , and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey 's end , though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond -- steak and kidney pudding , drink or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant .
Oh yes , human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn , when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back , and if there is such a thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it , on the banks of the Thames , where the great streets join and St. Paul's Cathedral , like the volute on the top of the snail shell , finishes it off .
Jacob , getting off his omnibus , loitered up the steps , consulted his watch , and finally made up his mind to go in ... .
These changes of mood wear us out .
Tristan was twitching his rug up under his armpits twice a week ; Isolde waved her scarf in miraculous sympathy with the conductor 's baton .
In all parts of the house were to be found pink faces and glittering breasts .
When a Royal hand attached to an invisible body slipped out and withdrew the red and white bouquet reposing on the scarlet ledge , the Queen of England seemed a name worth dying for .
`` Yes ; that should make him sit up , '' said Bonamy , as Jacob stopped reading .
`` Distinction '' -- Mrs. Durrant said that Jacob Flanders was `` distinguished-looking . ''
Seeing him for the first time that no doubt is the word for him .
Then his mouth -- but surely , of all futile occupations this of cataloguing features is the worst .
The housemaid found herself very liberally rewarded .
( `` I 'm twenty-two .
`` I 'm awfully happy since I 've known you , Jacob .
You 're such a GOOD man . ''
`` Are you going away for Christmas ? ''
`` Calthorp , '' said Mr. Calthorp .
`` Going about as girls do nowadays -- '' said Mrs. Forster .
`` Holborn straight ahead of you , '' says the policeman .
The wine was excellent .
She called herself `` an old woman '' -- '' so kind to lunch with an old woman '' -- which flattered him .
She said that Jacob must come and meet -- one of our celebrities .
They never noticed her .
And Bonamy , all his hair touzled and his tie flying , broke off , and pushed Sanders into the arm-chair , and said Mr. Sanders had smashed the coffee-pot and he was teaching Mr. Sanders --
wetting her pen in bitterness , and leaving her shoe laces untied .
When her books came she applied herself to her gigantic labours , but perceived through one of the nerves of her exasperated sensibility how composedly , unconcernedly , and with every consideration the male readers applied themselves to theirs .
That young man for example .
What had he got to do except copy out poetry ?
But what brought Jacob Flanders to read Marlowe in the British Museum ?
Youth , youth -- something savage -- something pedantic .
For example , there is Mr. Masefield , there is Mr. Bennett .
Do n't palter with the second rate .
Detest your own age .
One must do the thing oneself .
And as Jacob was one of them , no doubt he looked a little regal and pompous as he turned his page , and Julia Hedge disliked him naturally enough .
Fanny 's eyes seemed to question , to commiserate , to be , for a second , love itself .
`` Hullo , never noticed you , '' said Nick , five minutes later .
Other girls in that very street sat over ledgers , or drew long threads wearily between silk and gauze ; or , festooned with ribbons in Swan and Edgars , rapidly added up pence and farthings on the back of the bill and twisted the yard and three-quarters in tissue paper and asked `` Your pleasure ? ''
There was his face .
She lit the lamp .
But as the daylight came through the window only half was lit up by the lamp .
And then they went to the little cafe in the by-street where people sit drinking coffee , watching the soldiers , meditatively knocking ashes into trays .
I ca n't help it .
I say , will King George give way about the peers ? ''
`` And we spend our days doing foolish unnecessary things without knowing why . ''
`` Now , my dear , I am going no further , '' said Mrs. Flanders .
They had climbed the dark hill and reached the Roman camp .
`` It is much clearer than this sometimes , '' said Mrs. Jarvis , standing upon the ridge .
There were no clouds , and yet there was a haze over the sea , and over the moors .
The lights of Scarborough flashed , as if a woman wearing a diamond necklace turned her head this way and that .
A stout gentleman laboriously hauled himself in , dusty , baggy , slung with gold chains , and Jacob , regretting that he did not come of the Latin race , looked out of the window .
Accidental villas among olive trees appear ; and men-servants watering the cactuses .
And what I should like would be to get out among the fields , sit down and hear the grasshoppers , and take up a handful of earth -- Italian earth , as this is Italian dust upon my shoes .
The waiter was quite indifferent to that too .
`` Those pink melons are sure to be dangerous , '' he said gloomily .
The yellow columns of the Parthenon are to be seen at all hours of the day firmly planted upon the Acropolis ; though at sunset , when the ships in the Piraeus fire their guns , a bell rings , a man in uniform ( the waistcoat unbuttoned ) appears ; and the women roll up the black stockings which they are knitting in the shadow of the columns , call to the children , and troop off down the hill back to their houses .
It had better be burnt .
`` Where are the men ? ''
It was strange , though .
Sandra dined in her hat , veiled as usual .
The motor cars passed incessantly over the bridge of the Serpentine ; the upper classes walked upright , or bent themselves gracefully over the palings ; the lower classes lay with their knees cocked up , flat on their backs ; the sheep grazed on pointed wooden legs ; small children ran down the sloping grass , stretched their arms , and fell .
`` Urbane '' on the lips of Jacob had mysteriously all the shapeliness of a character which Bonamy thought daily more sublime , devastating , terrific than ever , though he was still , and perhaps would be for ever , barbaric , obscure .
`` There 's none of this European mysticism , '' said Jacob .
`` He 's like Jacob , '' said Florinda , looking at the newcomer .
Jacob , leaning forward , drew a plan of the Parthenon in the dust in Hyde Park , a network of strokes at least , which may have been the Parthenon , or again a mathematical diagram .
It was not to count his notes that he took out a wad of papers and read a long flowing letter which Sandra had written two days ago at Milton Dower House with his book before her and in her mind the memory of something said or attempted , some moment in the dark on the road to the Acropolis which ( such was her creed ) mattered for ever .
`` Jacob , '' she went on , going to the window and looking over the spotted flower-beds across the grass where the piebald cows grazed under beech trees , `` Jacob would be shocked . ''
What was it that he knew ?
`` I do n't know -- really , '' said Clara , looking at the blazing windows .
But the red light was on the columns of the Parthenon , and the Greek women who were knitting their stockings and sometimes crying to a child to come and have the insects picked from its head were as jolly as sand-martins in the heat , quarrelling , scolding , suckling their babies , until the ships in the Piraeus fired their guns .
The rooms are shapely , the ceilings high ; over the doorways a rose or a ram 's skull is carved in the wood .
`` What am I to do with these , Mr .
`` For a Divine he was -- remarkably free . ''
she said at length , upon which they rose and left , vaguely to the surprise of the gentlemen , who had either thought them attentive or had forgotten their presence .
`` I expect you 're too severe , '' Helen remarked .
At this Helen immediately brightened more than she had yet done , and explained that her son was six and her daughter ten .
Everybody said that her boy was like her and her girl like Ridley .
As for brains , they were quick brats , she thought , and modestly she ventured on a little story about her son , -- how left alone for a minute he had taken the pat of butter in his fingers , run across the room with it , and put it on the fire -- merely for the fun of the thing , a feeling which she could understand .
he asked , shifting them painfully .
Beginning with the Greeks , who had , he said , many difficulties to contend with , he continued with the Romans , passed to England and the right method , which speedily became the wrong method , and wound up with such a fury of denunciation directed against the road-makers of the present day in general , and the road-makers of Richmond Park in particular , where Mr. Pepper had the habit of cycling every morning before breakfast , that the spoons fairly jingled against the coffee cups , and the insides of at least four rolls mounted in a heap beside Mr. Pepper 's plate .
They followed her on to the deck .
They had left London sitting on its mud .
The colourless October sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood-fire smoke , and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk .
Indeed it was too cold to stand still .
One could scarcely see the black ribs of wrecked ships , or the spiral towers made by the burrowings of great eels , or the smooth green-sided monsters who came by flickering this way and that .
Did you notice the counterpanes ?
The one I gave Mr. Pepper was hardly fit to cover a dog .
Some had yellow stains , others had places where the threads made long ladders ; but to the ordinary eye they looked much as sheets usually do look , very chill , white , cold , and irreproachably clean .
I always think it a particularly cheerful plant . ''
`` A well-bred child is no responsibility .
`` She sat outside the house ; it was very awkward , '' said Dalloway .
`` At last I plucked up courage and said to her , 'My good creature , you're only in the way where you are .
`` Serve them right , '' said Willoughby curtly .
`` All one 's faculties have their play , '' said Richard .
Now , I should n't like to think that any one had to make allowances for me . ''
A detestable prig ! ''
Ridley engaged her to come to-morrow .
`` When you see a musician with long hair , do n't you know instinctively that he 's bad ? ''
Her yawn must have been the image of a yawn .
Already this cramped little cabin was the dressing room of a lady of quality .
A pen in her hands became a thing one caressed paper with , and she might have been stroking and tickling a kitten as she wrote :
`` We had a dog who was a bore and knew it , '' he said , addressing her in cool , easy tones .
You ca n't imagine a greater contrast .
`` Do n't talk of it ! ''
`` It 's a thing I ca n't bear to think of to this day . ''
`` There 's nothing like it , '' she concluded .
Mrs. Dalloway went on :
`` When I was your age I wanted too .
He gave me all I wanted .
I often wonder what I've done to be so happy ! ''
She wiped it away , squeezed Rachel 's hand , and exclaimed :
`` Sisters and a dormouse and some canaries , '' Rachel murmured , never taking her eyes off him .
`` I wonder , I wonder '' she ceased , her chin upon her hand , still looking at him .
To wake and find oneself left alone with one was also slightly disconcerting .
I think I agree with him .
-- settling the basis of a future state with the present Secretary for India .
I 'm not sure we were n't .
We were happy , Miss Vinrace , and we were young -- gifts which make for wisdom . ''
`` I call myself a Conservative for convenience sake , '' said Richard , smiling .
`` But there is more in common between the two parties than people generally allow . ''
There could be no doubt that her interest was genuine .
`` Ours , Dick ? ''
It happened at tea ; the expected paroxysm of the blast gave out just as it reached its climax and dwindled away , and the ship instead of taking the usual plunge went steadily .
`` Yes , '' said Helen , `` he 's always been like that . ''
Pride glowed in his eye as he let the wind buffet him and stood firm .
With his head slightly lowered he sheered round corners , strode uphill , and met the blast .
There was a collision .
It was Rachel who apologised .
They both laughed , too much blown about to speak .
In order to speak to her , it was necessary that Richard should follow .
They stood in a whirlpool of wind ; papers began flying round in circles , the door crashed to , and they tumbled , laughing , into chairs .
`` I made you think !
She wanted to make her niece talk , and so to understand why this rather dull , kindly , plausible politician had made so deep an impression on her , for surely at the age of twenty-four this was not natural .
`` But how does one know ? ''
However they were come by , they were sufficiently serious to send Mrs. Ambrose a day or two later in search of her brother-in-law .
Above him hung a photograph of a woman's head .
Nevertheless it was the head of an individual and interesting woman , who would no doubt have turned and laughed at Willoughby if she could have caught his eye ; but when he looked up at her he sighed profoundly .
He was a very ambitious man ; and although he had not been particularly kind to her while she lived , as Helen thought , he now believed that she watched him from Heaven , and inspired what was good in him .
Mrs. Ambrose apologised for the interruption , and asked whether she might speak to him about a plan of hers .
Would he consent to leave his daughter with them when they landed , instead of taking her on up the Amazons ?
Granted facility of travel , peace , good trade , and so on , there was besides a kind of dissatisfaction among the English with the older countries and the enormous accumulations of carved stone , stained glass , and rich brown painting which they offered to the tourist .
It began by a few schoolmasters serving their passage out to South America as the pursers of tramp steamers .
She , too , had been a little stirred by the talk of a new world , where there was always sun and never a fog , which went on around her , and the chance , when they were planning where to spend the winter out of England , seemed too good to be missed .
For these reasons she determined to accept Willoughby 's offer of free passages on his ship , to place the children with their grand-parents , and to do the thing thoroughly while she was about it .
`` An hotel ? ''
`` If you die of dulness , neither will I , '' Helen echoed in her heart .
It was worth coming if only for the sake of the flowering trees which grew wild quite near the house , and the amazing colours of sea and earth .
`` You wo n't believe me , '' she added , `` there is no colour like it in England . ''
Rumours of London all in a ferment over a General Election had reached them even out here .
`` It seems incredible , '' she went on , `` that people should care whether Asquith is in or Austen Chamberlin out , and while you scream yourselves hoarse about politics you let the only people who are trying for something good starve or simply laugh at them .
For some reason the mention of letters always made Ridley groan , and the rest of the meal passed in a brisk argument between husband and wife as to whether he was or was not wholly ignored by the entire civilised world .
`` Am I a fool ? ''
`` He pinched my arm ! ''
She ducked her head immediately , for at the sound of his name he looked up .
`` All the luck 's on our side , '' said a young man who until now had kept his back turned to the window .
Very different was the room through the wall , though as like in shape as one egg-box is like another .
As Miss Allan read her book , Susan Warrington was brushing her hair .
Ages have consecrated this hour , and the most majestic of all domestic actions , to talk of love between women ; but Miss Warrington being alone could not talk ; she could only look with extreme solicitude at her own face in the glass .
She turned her head from side to side , tossing heavy locks now this way now that ; and then withdrew a pace or two , and considered herself seriously .
With its profoundly peaceful sighs and hesitations it resembled that of a cow standing up to its knees all night through in the long grass .
`` Two minutes , '' said Hirst , raising his finger .
`` So I used to think once , '' said Hirst .
You could draw circles round the whole lot of them , and they 'd never stray outside . ''
said Hirst , examining the big toe on his left foot .
`` The world is profoundly pleasant . ''
He lay back on the bed , upon his arms .
`` And supposing my bubble could run into some one else 's bubble -- ''
`` Thank God , you 'll never get the donkeys , '' said Hirst .
The couple therefore sat themselves down in arm-chairs and waited .
`` You have read it ? ''
Mrs. Thornbury asked Miss Allan .
Indeed , if so much as a drop had melted off his spare ribs , the bones would have lain bare .
`` I really do n't need cooking , Susan , '' said Mrs. Paley , when her niece returned .
`` I must trouble you to move me . ''
Everything had to be moved .
Susan poured out tea , and was just remarking that they were having hot weather in Wiltshire too , when Mr. Venning asked whether he might join them .
`` I 'd rather go without lunch than tea , '' said Mr. Venning .
`` That 's not strictly true .
His friend Mr. Perrott was a barrister , and as Mr. Perrott refused to go anywhere without Mr. Venning it was necessary , when Mr. Perrott came to Santa Marina about a Company , for Mr. Venning to come too .
The talk rambled on .
`` You know Mr. Ambrose , Hilda ?
Everyone ought to stay at home .
With great slowness the door opened and a tall human being came towards her , holding out her arm and saying :
The utter absurdity of a woman coming into a room with a piece of paper in her hand amazed Rachel .
`` Expeditions in such heat are perhaps a little unwise , '' Mrs. Elliot murmured to Miss Allan .
`` You fly ? ''
`` I hope to , some day , '' said Arthur .
At Hewet 's suggestion it was decided to adopt the methods of modern warfare against an invading army .
The table-cloth represented the invaded country , and round it they built barricades of baskets , set up the wine bottles in a rampart , made fortifications of bread and dug fosses of salt .
Playing this game they lost their stiffness , and even became unusually daring , for Mr. Perrott , who was very shy , said , `` Permit me , '' and removed an ant from Evelyn 's neck .
`` How it makes one long to be a man ! ''
The two parties who were strolling about and losing their unity now came together , and joined each other in a long stare over the yellow and green patches of the heated landscape below .
The hot air danced across it , making it impossible to see the roofs of a village on the plain distinctly .
Even on the top of the mountain where a breeze played lightly , it was very hot , and the heat , the food , the immense space , and perhaps some less well-defined cause produced a comfortable drowsiness and a sense of happy relaxation in them .
In the silence that followed , holding his hand tightly in hers , she prayed to God that she might make him a good wife .
But Rachel was still agitated ; she could not get away from the sight they had just seen .
Instead of answering Hewet she persisted .
`` Yes , '' he added after a moment 's consideration , `` there 's something horribly pathetic about it , I agree . ''
`` Nothing , '' said Helen .
Were n't your nurses just the same ? ''
`` We must follow suit , '' said Hirst to Rachel , and he took her resolutely by the elbow .
Rachel , without being expert , danced well , because of a good ear for rhythm , but Hirst had no taste for music , and a few dancing lessons at Cambridge had only put him into possession of the anatomy of a waltz , without imparting any of its spirit .
A single turn proved to them that their methods were incompatible ; instead of fitting into each other their bones seemed to jut out in angles making smooth turning an impossibility , and cutting , moreover , into the circular progress of the other dancers .
The forms of great black trees rose massively in front of her .
She heard the trampling and swinging of the dancers behind her , and the rhythmic sway of the waltz music .
`` It 's no good ; we should live separate ; we can not understand each other ; we only bring out what 's worst . ''
They stopped to look in at the drawing-room , and perceived Mr. Pepper writing alone at a table .
`` It makes me sick , '' he declared .
`` The whole thing makes me sick .
Miss Allan looked at her watch .
Rachel occupied herself in collecting one grey stone after another and building them into a little cairn ; she did it very quietly and carefully .
`` Well , '' he demanded , `` which shall it be ? ''
That was Mr. Dalloway , '' she confessed .
she demanded , after a long silence ; each word as it came into being seemed to shove itself out into an unknown sea .
A lady , who was reading with great concentration , unfastened her brooch and gave it to her husband without looking at him or acknowledging the tentative bow which Mr. Elliot was desirous of giving her .
If she had listened , she might have been amused by the reference to old Lady Barborough , her great-aunt , but , oblivious of her surroundings , she went on reading .
`` It was Maurice Fielding , of course , that your mother was engaged to , '' said Helen 's voice .
Evelyn seemed to intimate that perhaps ten was the right figure , but that it really was not a high one .
`` I suppose I 'm too fastidious .
`` What was that you were saying ? ''
Helen remarked , after an interval of conversation which no third person could have understood .
He bent his wrist back sharply .
`` I hear little pieces of chalk grinding together ! ''
He could look at Rachel without her noticing it .
She was still absorbed in the water and the exquisitely pleasant sensations which a little depth of the sea washing over rocks suggests .
As she looked down into the sea , her lips were slightly parted .
Nevertheless her twenty-four years of life had given her a look of reserve .
Her hand , which lay on the ground , the fingers curling slightly in , was well shaped and competent ; the square-tipped and nervous fingers were the fingers of a musician .
With something like anguish Hewet realised that , far from being unattractive , her body was very attractive to him .
Her eyes were full of eagerness and interest .
When he said this , Rachel , who had become oblivious of anything , and had reverted to a childlike state of interest and pleasure , lost her freedom and became self-conscious .
She felt herself at once singular and under observation , as she felt with St. John Hirst .
She was about to launch into an argument which would have made them both feel bitterly against each other , and to define sensations which had no such importance as words were bound to give them when Hewet led her thoughts in a different direction .
Again she had become absorbed in something else , and he called her back to an unusually vivid consciousness of herself .
It was Rachel 's turn now to feel depressed .
As he talked of writing he had become suddenly impersonal .
Acquaintances showed signs of developing into friends , for that one tie to Mrs. Parry 's drawing-room had inevitably split into many other ties attached to different parts of England , and sometimes these alliances seemed cynically fragile , and sometimes painfully acute , lacking as they did the supporting background of organised English life .
Standing in the pulpit he looked very large and fat ; the light coming through the greenish unstained window-glass made his face appear smooth and white like a very large egg .
It might have been either of them and while Mrs. Flushing proceeded to describe them both , and to say that both frightened her , but one frightened her more than the other , Rachel looked for a chair .
The door was opened by a handsome maid who was almost as upright as her mistress .
he broke out , `` what 's the use of attempting to write when the world 's peopled by such damned fools ?
Seriously , Hewet , I advise you to give up literature .
There 's your audience . ''
`` Oh , you 're free ! ''
No lives would compare with ours . ''
He opened his arms wide as if to hold her and the world in one embrace .
`` And that 's my dad , '' said Evelyn , for there were two photographs in one frame .
While she went to wipe the button-hook , Rachel bit the ginger and at once cried , `` I must spit it out ! ''
`` I was just saying that people are so like their boots , '' said Miss Allan .
This misunderstanding , which involved a complete block in the passage , seemed to her unbearable .
She walked quickly and blindly in the opposite direction , and found herself at the end of a _cul_ _de_ _sac_ .
There was a window , and a table and a chair in the window , and upon the table stood a rusty inkstand , an ashtray , an old copy of a French newspaper , and a pen with a broken nib .
Looking out of the window with eyes that would have seen nothing even had they not been dazed by tears , she indulged herself at last in violent abuse of the entire day .
All day long she had been tantalized and put off .
The group indeed had come together in a miscellaneous way ; one tea-table joining to another tea-table , and deck-chairs serving to connect two groups .
Her voice mounted too , in a mild ecstasy of satisfaction with her life and her own nature .
`` It 's so unpleasant , being cooped up with people one hardly knows , '' she remarked .
`` People who mind being seen naked . ''
`` You do n't mean to go ? ''
At the moment it appeared to Rachel that she had always seen the same faults in Helen , from the very first night on board the _Euphrosyne_ , in spite of her beauty , in spite of her magnanimity and their love .
They seemed to be driving into the heart of the night , for the trees closed in front of them , and they could hear all round them the rustling of leaves .
The great darkness had the usual effect of taking away all desire for communication by making their words sound thin and small ; and , after walking round the deck three or four times , they clustered together , yawning deeply , and looking at the same spot of deep gloom on the banks .
Murmuring very low in the rhythmical tone of one oppressed by the air , Mrs. Flushing began to wonder where they were to sleep , for they could not sleep downstairs , they could not sleep in a doghole smelling of oil , they could not sleep on deck , they could not sleep -- She yawned profoundly .
It was as Helen had foreseen ; the question of nakedness had risen already , although they were half asleep , and almost invisible to each other .
With St. John's help she stretched an awning , and persuaded Mrs. Flushing that she could take off her clothes behind this , and that no one would notice if by chance some part of her which had been concealed for forty-five years was laid bare to the human eye .
Silence seemed to have fallen upon the world .
`` We love each other , '' she repeated .
They walked on in silence as people walking in their sleep , and were oddly conscious now and again of the mass of their bodies .
He gathered them together and made them come down to the river-bank , where the boat was waiting to row them out to the steamer .
It was so hot that they scarcely moved , except now to change a foot , or , again , to strike a match .
On both banks of the river lay an open lawn-like space , grass covered and planted , for the gentleness and order of the place suggested human care , with graceful trees on the top of little mounds .
As far as they could gaze , this lawn rose and sank with the undulating motion of an old English park .
`` Well , '' Terence sighed at length , `` it makes us seem insignificant , does n't it ? ''
`` Hush , '' she checked them , `` Mrs. Flushing , remember .
`` You 're like a bird half asleep in its nest , Rachel .
You 're talking in your sleep . ''
They were accordingly left alone until they felt the silence as if , playing in a vast church , the door had been shut on them .
They were driven to walk alone , and sit alone , to visit secret places where the flowers had never been picked and the trees were solitary .
In solitude they could express those beautiful but too vast desires which were so oddly uncomfortable to the ears of other men and women -- desires for a world , such as their own world which contained two people seemed to them to be , where people knew each other intimately and thus judged each other by what was good , and never quarrelled , because that was waste of time .
They were no longer embarrassed , or half-choked with meaning which could not express itself ; they were not afraid of each other , or , like travellers down a twisting river , dazzled with sudden beauties when the corner is turned ; the unexpected happened , but even the ordinary was lovable , and in many ways preferable to the ecstatic and mysterious , for it was refreshingly solid , and called out effort , and effort under such circumstances was not effort but delight .
-- what corresponds to it in your sex ?
Oh , what lies -- what lies ! ''
`` And my father 'll be here in a day or two . ''
Merely to be so close soothed them , and sitting side by side the divisions disappeared , and it seemed as if the world were once more solid and entire , and as if , in some strange way , they had grown larger and stronger .
`` She thinks there can be nothing _quite_ so thrilling as mathematics , so I 've lent her a large work in two volumes .
the eyes of all those women ! ''
Yes , this arm-chair was the same arm-chair in which Rachel had sat that afternoon when Evelyn came up , and this was the magazine she had been looking at , and this the very picture , a picture of New York by lamplight .
How odd it seemed -- nothing had changed .
`` They give a great deal to their children . ''
`` It must be very wonderful , very wonderful indeed . ''
In order to get rid of this terrible stationary sight Rachel again shut her eyes , and found herself walking through a tunnel under the Thames , where there were little deformed women sitting in archways playing cards , while the bricks of which the wall was made oozed with damp , which collected into drops and slid down the wall .
But the little old women became Helen and Nurse McInnis after a time , standing in the window together whispering , whispering incessantly .
He always concluded as he left her room that it was worse to see her than not to see her , but by degrees , as the day wore on , the desire to see her returned and became almost too great to be borne .
Rachel was ill ; that was all ; he must see that there was medicine and milk , and that things were ready when they were wanted .
Thought had ceased ; life itself had come to a standstill .
The separate feelings of pleasure , interest , and pain , which combine to make up the ordinary day , were merged in one long-drawn sensation of sordid misery and profound boredom .
He had never been so bored since he was shut up in the nursery alone as a child .
It was strange that he had never seen this before .
`` The name and address of the doctor is -- ? ''
`` Old fellow , '' he began , as Terence still refused , and stopped abruptly , fearing sentimentality ; he found that he was on the verge of tears .
This morning also for the first time Ridley found it impossible to sit alone in his room .
Too restless to read , and having nothing to do , he began to pace up and down reciting poetry in an undertone .
Occupied in various ways -- now in undoing parcels , now in uncorking bottles , now in writing directions , the sound of Ridley 's song and the beat of his pacing worked into the minds of Terence and St. John all the morning as a half comprehended refrain .
Housemaids were passing briskly from room to room , but Mrs. Thornbury avoided them ; she hardly saw them ; they seemed to her to be in another world .
It was evident that Evelyn had been lately in tears , and when she looked at Mrs. Thornbury she began to cry again .
When she was alone by herself she clenched her fists together , and began beating the back of a chair with them .
She would not submit to dark and nothingness .
She looked stubborn and strong when she had ceased to cry .
Evelyn 's questions made him too feel uncomfortable .
Until I met you I had gone on in my own quiet way -- we are both very quiet people , my sister and I -- quite content with my lot .
You seem to put such a spirit into everything .
Life seems to hold so many possibilities that I had never dreamt of . ''
`` D'you know , '' said Mrs. Elliot , after a moment , `` I do n't think people _do_ write good novels now -- not as good as they used to , anyhow . ''
`` Who tells you that ?
A yellow light flashed across the blue window , and for a second they saw the green trees outside .
She strode to the door , pushed it open , and stood half out in the open air .
