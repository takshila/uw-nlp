However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not .
cried his wife impatiently .
`` Is he married or single ? ''
What a fine thing for our girls ! ''
How can it affect them ? ''
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ''
`` Is that his design in settling here ? ''
`` I see no occasion for that .
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . ''
`` My dear , you flatter me .
`` In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . ''
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers .
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ''
`` I desire you will do no such thing .
But you are always giving _her_ the preference . ''
`` Mr. Bennet , how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way ?
I have a high respect for your nerves .
`` It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ''
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .
When she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous .
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .
`` We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes , '' said her mother resentfully , `` since we are not to visit . ''
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ''
`` Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , '' said her father ; `` she times them ill. '' `` I do not cough for my own amusement , '' replied Kitty fretfully .
`` To-morrow fortnight . ''
Mrs. Bennet said only , `` Nonsense , nonsense ! ''
`` What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? ''
What say you , Mary ?
And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether -- Mr. Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .
you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general .
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .
and his answering immediately to the last question : 'Oh !
`` You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound .
The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self-importance of all those people !
What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! ''
`` Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .
`` My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment ; nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had , in fact , nothing to do elsewhere .
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .
A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs. Hurst began again :
`` Miss Eliza Bennet , '' said Miss Bingley , `` despises cards .
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .
It must be an amusing study . ''
`` Yes , but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing .
They have at least that advantage . ''
`` The country , '' said Darcy , `` can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study .
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ''
`` You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ''
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her :
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .
You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage .
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep .
`` I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , '' said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
`` You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I would be completely in your way , and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ''
`` Such as vanity and pride . ''
`` Do let us have a little music , '' cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained :
`` You are very kind , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough .
Things are settled so oddly . ''
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins 's admiration .
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing .
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ''
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .
I can recall nothing worse .
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme , assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ; and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
`` You are too hasty , sir , '' she cried .
Let me do it without further loss of time .
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
`` It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_ . ''
`` I see what you are feeling , '' replied Charlotte .
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter -- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed :
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .
exclaimed Elizabeth , `` you are too good .
`` And do you impute it to either of those ? ''
`` Yes ; to the last .
`` True , '' said Mr. Bennet , `` but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it . ''
It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins 's wife by this time , had it not been for her own perverseness .
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .
To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
They had , therefore , many acquaintances in common ; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy 's father , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring .
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime .
I pity , though I can not help blaming her .
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side .
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy -- your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .
Let me hear from you very soon .
We had better not mention it .
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ''
`` No -- why should he ?
If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ''
`` _Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_ .
`` Yes , ma'am , all . ''
`` Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company .
The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first .
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive !
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ''
`` I assure you , madam , '' he replied , `` that she does not need such advice .
`` True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room .
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
`` An easy distance , do you call it ?
But when Elizabeth told of his silence ; it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard-table , but gentlemen can not always be within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
`` And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .
`` To Jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection ; all loveliness and goodness as she is !
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .
She remembered also that , till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son .
Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects that occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and , on the other , retailing them all to the younger Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her .
`` A little sea-bathing would set me up forever . ''
He heard her attentively , and then said :
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ''
`` Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _that_ will be .
I do not know who is good enough for him . ''
`` I say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , '' replied the other .
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth 's feelings was at every moment increasing .
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and , oh !
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner .
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it `` was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; '' and , before she could reply , he added , `` It is above eight months .
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence .
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .
Lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , `` I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern .
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .
Oh , no , no -- this is not likely .
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .
When Mrs. Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
Have you heard from my uncle ? ''
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents .
This was one point , with regard to Lydia , at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .
`` Haye Park might do , '' said she , `` if the Gouldings could quit it -- or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off !
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Pulvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . ''
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .
His daughter 's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North .
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .
She replied in the affirmative .
At such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ''
`` I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .
We passed each other several times .
I wonder what he can be doing there . ''
I do n't know .
He knows where we live .
As the day of his arrival drew near , --
`` I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ''
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . ''
Come be quick , be quick !
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet 's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ''
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter , and said :
Your tempers are by no means unlike .
Mrs. Bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .
`` I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ''
And she rose as she spoke .
Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof .
I can not think of it without abhorrence . ''
I hope you have destroyed the letter .
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .
`` From the former .
`` You know nothing of the matter .
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ''
And do you really love him quite well enough ?
do anything rather than marry without affection .
`` Have you any other objection , '' said Elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? ''
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
Mrs. Phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar .
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed .
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
`` Why , to be sure , '' said her husband , very gravely , `` that would make great difference .
The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with .
If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . ''
`` You may esteem him . ''
`` My love , it will be scarcely a separation .
You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother .
`` It is but a cottage , '' she continued , `` but I hope to see many of my friends in it .
HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland .
Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment .
But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland .
As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles .
On each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs .
Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house .
It was very early in September ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation .
Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties .
But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty-five any objection to his marrying HER . ''
`` Upon my soul , '' said he , `` I do not know much about him as to all THAT .
Was she out with him today ? ''
His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment .
They read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted .
Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret ,
`` None at all , ma'am , I thank you . ''
`` I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ''
But , however , I hope you will think better of it .
Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . ''
The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon 's visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance .
To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover 's heart could give , and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother .
The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .
`` Is anything the matter with her ? ''
`` It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT .
He had not the power of accepting it .
I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . ''
It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it .
I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning ; -- he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality .
But there was one method so direct , so simple , and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair , and of instantly removing all mystery , that she could not help suggesting it to her mother .
I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one .
`` Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ?
Are the Middletons pleasant people ? ''
Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural .
They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood .
He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits .
`` About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . ''
replied he , with a sigh .
`` But gaiety never was a part of MY character . ''
`` Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , '' said Elinor ; `` I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . ''
`` Quite the contrary , '' replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne .
She was sitting by Edward , and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers .
He coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at Elinor , replied , `` Yes ; it is my sister 's hair .
His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs .
`` Never mind if they do .
`` But indeed you must and shall come .
I am sure you will like it of all things .
The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful .
it is very fatiguing to him !
`` Upon my word , '' replied Elinor , `` you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . ''
`` Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things .
He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school .
However , I am much happier as I am .
Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . ''
The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable .
Their dress was very smart , their manners very civil , they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture , and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton 's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park .
She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration .
It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself .
But Sir John could not prevail .
Here too , Miss Dashwood 's commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat .
To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars , -- and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister 's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .
repeated Miss Steele ; `` Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ?
`` I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , '' said she , `` in telling you all this .
I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance .
She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether .
I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years .
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . ''
Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer .
This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete .
These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !
Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .
On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support .
That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . ''
Their departure took place in the first week in January .
The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family .
Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last .
`` Yes , '' he replied , with some embarrassment , `` almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . ''
`` Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ?
How does Charlotte do ?
It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there .
`` Aye , aye , '' said Mrs. Jennings , `` we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . ''
she exclaimed , `` he is there -- he is there -- Oh !
why can not I speak to him ? ''
I wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night , but I will not depend on it .
At any rate I shall expect you to-morrow .
For the present , adieu .
But the family are all rich together .
and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces .
dashing about with his curricle and hunters !
`` What did you hear ? ''
Marianne moved to the window --
The rest of Mrs. Palmer 's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to Elinor .
Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing .
It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . ''
-- she hardly knew how she could bear it !
-- it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . ''
So exceeding affable as she was !
And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .
-- '' So calm !
-- how have you been supported ? ''
Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion .
I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself .
I have many things to support me .
I acquit Edward of essential misconduct .
-- And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.
-- They are brought more within my comprehension . ''
But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time .
Elinor told him that it was .
I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift .
-- Very far from it , indeed .
`` We think NOW , '' -- said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , `` of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton . ''
She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris , or if HE could not come , for some other advice , when the former -- but not till after five o'clock -- arrived .
He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them .
Elinor would not speak .
The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever .
At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display .
And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
Good bye , -- God bless you ! ''
Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits .
She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .
Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .
Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything ; -- Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.
-- His own merits must soon secure it . ''
But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise .
-- That would not do.
She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard .
-- She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them .
-- For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before -- '' I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change .
She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all .
But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self-provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay .
Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done .
But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen .
I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging .
She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
`` She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.
Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy .
A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful .
Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive .
Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor .
They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends .

If a woman may ever be said to be in safety from the determined Perseverance of disagreeable Lovers and the cruel Persecutions of obstinate Fathers , surely it must be at such a time of Life .
Tho ' my Charms are now considerably softened and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone , I was once beautiful .
Of every accomplishment accustomary to my sex , I was Mistress .
A sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my Freinds , my Acquaintance and particularly to every affliction of my own , was my only fault , if a fault it could be called .
My accomplishments too , begin to fade -- I can neither sing so well nor Dance so gracefully as I once did -- and I have entirely forgot the MINUET DELA COUR .
She had passed 2 Years at one of the first Boarding-schools in London ; had spent a fortnight in Bath and had supped one night in Southampton .
( exclaimed I ) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never be exposed to ?
little did I then think I was ordained so soon to quit that humble Cottage for the Deceitfull Pleasures of the World .
LETTER 5th LAURA to MARIANNE One Evening in December as my Father , my Mother and myself , were arranged in social converse round our Fireside , we were on a sudden greatly astonished , by hearing a violent knocking on the outward door of our rustic Cot .
( cried I . )
`` I am of your opinion ; ( said my Father ) it certainly does appear to proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending door . ''
`` That is another point ( replied he ; ) We must not pretend to determine on what motive the person may knock -- tho ' that someone DOES rap at the door , I am partly convinced . ''
( replied I . )
( answered he . )
let no time be lost '' ( cried I . )
( said my Mother . )
`` I think there must , '' ( replied my Father ) `` I fancy the servants are returned ; ( said I ) I think I hear Mary going to the Door . ''
`` You have no objection , my Dear ? ''
( said my Father . )
`` None in the World . ''
Mary , without waiting for any further commands immediately left the room and quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable Youth , I had ever beheld .
He told us that he was the son of an English Baronet , that his Mother had been for many years no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size .
No never exclaimed I .
Never shall it be said that I obliged my Father . ''
We remained but a few days after our Marriage , in the Vale of Uske .
After taking an affecting Farewell of my Father , my Mother and my Isabel , I accompanied Edward to his Aunt 's in Middlesex .
`` Only those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink . ''
( answered she . )
To compleat such unparalelled Barbarity we were informed that an Execution in the House would shortly take place .
what could we do but what we did !
We sighed and fainted on the sofa .
But as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated Enquiries , I gained little , or indeed , no information concerning him .
no , no , ( exclaimed Sophia ) I can not go to Newgate ; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus in so cruel a confinement -- my feelings are sufficiently shocked by the RECITAL , of his Distress , but to behold it will overpower my Sensibility . ''
But never shall I be able so far to conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him .
in the perusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely tried .
what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which I have already related to you , to the one I am now going to inform you of .
my fears were but too fully justified ; she grew gradually worse -- and I daily became more alarmed for her .
At length she was obliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy Landlady -- .
I die a Martyr to my greif for the loss of Augustus.. One fatal swoon has cost me my Life.. Beware of swoons Dear Laura ... .
LETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle March 20th
she still laments his Death with undiminished constancy , notwithstanding he has been dead more than six weeks ; but some People mind such things more than others .
The ill state of Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak , and so unable to support the least exertion , that she has been in tears all this Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs. Marlowe who with her Husband , Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning .
Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own satisfaction in the year 1399 , after having prevailed on his cousin and predecessor Richard the 2nd , to resign it to him , and to retire for the rest of his life to Pomfret Castle , where he happened to be murdered .
It is however but Justice , and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely innocent of the Crimes with which she was accused , and of which her Beauty , her Elegance , and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs , not to mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence , the weakness of the Charges against her , and the King 's Character ; all of which add some confirmation , tho ' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those before alledged in her favour .
The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince , were too numerous to be mentioned , ( as this history I trust has fully shown ; ) and nothing can be said in his vindication , but that his abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite use to the landscape of England in general , which probably was a principal motive for his doing it , since otherwise why should a Man who was of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which had for ages been established in the Kingdom .
On his Majesty 's death he was succeeded by his son Charles .
`` Ride where you may , Be Candid where you can , '' she added , '' I rode once , but it is many years ago -- She spoke this in so low and tremulous a Voice , that I was silent -- .
Struck with her Manner of speaking I could make no reply .
`` You may well wear that look of astonishment , said she , since what I have said must appear improbable to you -- Yet nothing is more true than that I once was married . ''
`` But my love why lament HIS perfidy , when you bore so well that of many young Men before ? ''
replied I with as much indifference as I could assume .
`` No , Ma'am !
`` Do you intend staying long in this part of England Miss Grenville ? ''
I think you the most amiable , and the handsomest Man in England , and so to be sure you are .
I quite die to see you .
How happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her house , and how happy every body in London must be because you are there .
I am my dearest Musgrove most truly and faithfully yours for ever and ever Henrietta Halton .
`` Nay my Love replied she , now you confirm my suspicions .
the dear Creature , cried I , how passionately he loves me !
But dear Lady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle and Aunt ? ''
Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary 's birth -- `` Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq .
Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .
To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter , favourite , and friend .
Lady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .
Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .
Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world .
Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .
He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .
He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .
The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married .
Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .
As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; `` For they must have been seen together , '' he observed , `` once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . ''
Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .
There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference .
He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell .
The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it .
Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word `` advertise , '' but never dared approach it again .
`` As to all that , '' rejoined Sir Walter coolly , `` supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it .
I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant .
At this moment I can not recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately .
As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant .
`` Mrs Clay , '' said she , warmly , `` never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .
If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .
That tooth of her 's and those freckles .
`` I can give you no account of them .
`` My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !
You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . ''
Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it .
To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp , flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction .
Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .
And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , `` I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma .
Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it .
It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but I know it is taken notice of by many persons . ''
Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought .
Perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances .
He must be either indifferent or unwilling .
Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .
`` I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire .
It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . ''
Charles , my dear , '' ( beckoning him to her ) , `` do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother .
A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth .
Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself .
As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta .
Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good-humoured wife .
`` Had you ? ''
And there was silence between them for a little while .
Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too .
The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .
After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .
The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood .
While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .
For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly .
They were all at her disposal .
But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary !
I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us .
What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other !
the great-coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . ''
She did : he was satisfied , and said no more .
They had an early account from Lyme the next morning .
No symptoms worse than before had appeared .
He was tolerably cheerful .
`` She really left nothing for Mary to do .
She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character .
`` And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , '' said Charles .
Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .
He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .
Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .
Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath .
when shall I leave you again ? ''
He staid an hour with them .
The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck `` eleven with its silver sounds , '' and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long .
Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin .
They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and `` Our cousins in Laura Place , '' -- '' Our cousin , Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , '' were talked of to everybody .
`` You are mistaken , '' said he gently , `` that is not good company ; that is the best .
Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice .
Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well .
Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ?
You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued !
My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! ''
Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for . ''
yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick .
He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of .
He spoke to her , and then turned away .
Who is your party ? ''
Anne half smiled and said , `` Do you see that in my eye ? ''
I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you .
There were many things to be taken into the account .
Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath .
You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him .
he is black at heart , hollow and black ! ''
Tunbridge Wells , '' and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : --
`` Dear Smith , -- I have received yours .
Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss .
He is worse than last year .
`` Only give me a hearing .
You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm .
Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement .
He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you .
They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known .
`` She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! ''
The visit passed off altogether in high good humour .
Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law 's carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her .
She had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms .
I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to-morrow night .
We all like a play .
Have not I done well , mother ? ''
Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . ''
You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . ''
They were obliged to move .
`` Have you finished your letter ? ''
I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . ''
In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow .
The only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell .
She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind .
There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .
There she felt her own inferiority very keenly .
She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
Mrs Smith 's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity .
I meant only myself .
We always say what we like to one another . ''
Mr. Knightley shook his head at her .
Pray do not make any more matches . ''
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .
She would be very glad to stay . ''
After these came a second set ; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case .
But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself .
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.
How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ can not gain by the acquaintance .
Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .
I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.
How well she looked last night ! ''
`` Such an eye !
She is loveliness itself .
`` Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister . ''
yes , I observed it , I assure you .
It was not lost on me .
`` No great variety of faces for you , '' said Emma .
Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see .
I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .
He had nestled down his head most conveniently .
That 's very like .
I am rather proud of little George .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
-- '' The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .
`` I can not agree with you .
This is a point which you must settle with your feelings . ''
-- But he has left my picture in Bond-street . ''
`` I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter .
I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . ''
Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .
He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused . ''
to be sure , '' cried Emma , `` it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .
Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .
Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing-master 's son . ''
Emma laughed and disclaimed .
`` Depend upon it , Elton will not do .
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece . ''
`` Mermaids and sharks !
Give me the paper and listen .
`` I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour .
Such things in general can not be too short . ''
`` I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , '' said she .
`` Very well , '' replied Emma ; `` a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased .
It will be giving him so much pleasure !
-- You must let me read it to him . ''
`` Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .
We copied it from the Elegant Extracts .
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid .
`` I do not know , my dear .
-- How very beautiful !
`` And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over , '' said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again .
`` I do not think it will , '' stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within .
`` It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.
-- You quite forget poor Mr .
-- It had a high claim to forbearance .
`` If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . ''
-- Indeed I am very sorry.
-- Come , shake hands with me . ''
`` Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone .
`` It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to-day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston .
I think your manners to him encouraging .
You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do . ''
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people 's not staying comfortably at home when they can !
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ; -- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ; -- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man 's house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to-morrow .
Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
Emma smiled and answered -- '' My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .
`` I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . ''
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings . ''
I should like to see two more here , -- your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete .
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank .
I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . ''
I am sorry for it .
Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
`` What is to be done , my dear Emma ?
was Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .
-- and an hundred other circumstances ; -- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .
There was no denying that those brothers had penetration .
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
`` The Churchills are very likely in fault , '' said Mr. Knightley , coolly ; `` but I dare say he might come if he would . ''
-- not at all , '' replied Mr. Knightley , rather displeased ; `` I do not want to think ill of him .
`` You will excuse my being so much over-powered .
You are so kind ! ''
She often says , when the letter is first opened , 'Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work ' -- do n't you , ma'am ?
And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God !
with the help of spectacles .
My mother 's are really very good indeed .
I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house .
I do not see it . ''
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way .
a great pity indeed !
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ? ''
`` When I have seen Mr. Elton , '' replied Jane , `` I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _that_ with me .
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . ''
Well , that is so very !
Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of .
There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .
She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ?
Ladies can never look ill. And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.
`` Well , '' said Emma , `` there is no disputing about taste.
`` Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . ''
Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight .
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley .
just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . ''
This was the occurrence : -- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .
On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them .
But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs .
`` You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible .
I need not tell you what is to be done .
We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday .
We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely .
You will not like staying late .
Her father 's comfort was amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.
`` I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !
-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .
-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . ''
`` I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.
-- It was the work of a moment .
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
`` I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention .
I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . ''
-- There is no understanding a word of it .
Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach .
How did you think the Coxes looked ? ''
`` He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . ''
-- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury ; -- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door , Mr. Cole 's carriage-horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker 's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
But still he went on measuring , and still he ended with ,
`` I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . ''
It is his own idea .
Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !
-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield .
-- You consent -- I hope you consent ? ''
`` But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited -- ''
`` I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care .
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , `` Men never know when things are dirty or not ; '' and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , `` Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . ''
I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . ''
Enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word .
This wretched note was the finale of Emma 's breakfast .
-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !
and she and her partner the happiest !
-- '' I said it would be so , '' was the only consolation .
Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .
This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest .
And then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . ''
continued Mrs. Elton ; `` Knightley himself !
'My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
`` Insufferable woman ! ''
was her immediate exclamation .
-- I could not have believed it .
I could not have believed it !
One would fancy we were bosom friends !
Much beyond my hopes .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
How angry and how diverted he would be !
there I am -- thinking of him directly .
How I catch myself out !
This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . ''
By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again -- '' Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw . ''
`` Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr .
`` Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . ''
She watched him well .
I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . ''
Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .
`` And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake ! ''
yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too .
`` And when , '' thought Emma , `` will there be a beginning of Mr .
The dream must be borne with , and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small-sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded .
Jane 's alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them .
She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr. Knightley .
That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey .
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey .
Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.
Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
It was not with Mrs. Suckling , it was not with Mrs. Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
-- '' Should not they walk ?
Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?
-- She wished to see the whole extent . ''
I shall be at home in twenty minutes . ''
`` You are sick of prosperity and indulgence .
You are my best cure . ''
`` No -- It will not be worth while .
Though , perhaps , as the _Chaperon_ of the party -- _I_ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women -- ''
Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her .
She recovered her voice .
-- '' Do n't ask me .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
You will not see him .
He is half way to Windsor by this time . ''
`` Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty .
Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family !
what do you mean ?
cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely -- '' Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake .
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's heart and time would be occupied by it .
They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also.
-- Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury .
They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe .
-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their 's !
She went on , however .
`` I have very little to say for my own conduct.
-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding .
He never wished to attach me .
It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.
-- It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _not_ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . ''
-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him .
-- With such a woman he has a chance.
-- You are wise -- but _I_ can not be wise .
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !
-- What does this mean ?
The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .
after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . ''
-- But how to break it to her father at last !
-- She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too .
-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world .
`` I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . ''
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . ''
but her lips were closed .
`` You mistake me , you quite mistake me , '' she replied , exerting herself .
`` It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it .
It seems an impossibility !
She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
Her father 's business was to announce James 's being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . ''
I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.
If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .
For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . ''
`` But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak .
I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ''
Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short !
It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken .
She liked him the better for being a clergyman , `` for she must confess herself very partial to the profession '' ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it .
The dreadful black veil !
They give themselves such airs .
They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance !
By the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man .
Pray let me know if they are coming .
I am determined I will not look up . ''
If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . ''
Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point ; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature , so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads , and the principal inn of the city , that a day never passes in which parties of ladies , however important their business , whether in quest of pastry , millinery , or even ( as in the present case ) of young men , are not detained on one side or other by carriages , horsemen , or carts .
He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ''
You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ''
James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , `` Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ''
But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything .
My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is .
Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? ''
That 's a good one !
Everything being then arranged , the servant who stood at the horse 's head was bid in an important voice `` to let him go , '' and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable , without a plunge or a caper , or anything like one .
What is there in that ?
Oh , curse it !
`` So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ''
`` Did you indeed ?
A vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . ''
`` Oh , horrid !
Am I never to be acquainted with him ?
I think it does not look amiss ; the sleeves were entirely my own thought .
Do you know , I get so immoderately sick of Bath ; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that , though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks , we would not live here for millions .
Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us .
You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks . ''
You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . ''
`` I can not go , because '' -- looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella's smile -- '' I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk .
They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . ''
`` And what do you think I said ? ''
-- lowering his voice -- '' well done , general , said I ; I am quite of your mind . ''
These painful ideas crossed her mind , though she said nothing .
Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , `` Nay , Catherine .
`` A most heavenly thought indeed !
The next morning was fair , and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party .
The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself .
`` Yes , '' added Miss Tilney , `` and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ''
It is a very nice word indeed !
And so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it .
So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable !
At this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer .
`` I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ''
It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong .
yes , '' rejoined the other , `` Maria is gone .
She was quite wild to go .
I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . ''
`` Morland says exactly the same , '' replied Isabella ; `` and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it .
Your brother , who might marry anybody ! ''
I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however .
`` By Jove , no more do I .
Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ?
Mr. and Mrs. Morland , relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter , felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye , and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire .
Wherever she felt attachment , she had been able to create it .
`` You do acquit me , then , of anything wrong ?
`` Psha , nonsense ! ''
was Isabella 's answer in the same half whisper .
yes -- I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house -- and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ''
But this will not happen to me , I am sure . ''
Why should it be placed here ?
The lock was silver , though tarnished from age ; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver , broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence ; and , on the centre of the lid , was a mysterious cipher , in the same metal .
If not originally theirs , by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family ?
At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged .
One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back .
An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her !
Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each .
A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her .
Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies .
Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men .
Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit -- or if he did not , his friends and children did .
Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ''
His cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her .
Catherine understood her : the general must be watched from home , before that room could be entered .
To what might not those doors lead ?
In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells , might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband .
Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility !
You have had a very fine day for your ride . ''
Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . ''
`` Yes , a great deal .
That is -- no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting .
Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities .
But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved , in the laws of the land , and the manners of the age .
There , such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend .
She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella 's having matched some fine netting-cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
This made it so particularly strange !
Let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; your love I do build upon .
We parted at last by mutual consent -- happy for me had we never met !
I can never expect to know such another woman !
Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart .
Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme .
`` If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy .
It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! ''
The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry 's banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
My own joy on the occasion is very sincere .
Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON
My dear Mother , -- You must not expect Reginald back again for some time .
I am , indeed , provoked at the artifice of this unprincipled woman ; what stronger proof of her dangerous abilities can be given than this perversion of Reginald 's judgment , which when he entered the house was so decidedly against her !
In his last letter he actually gave me some particulars of her behaviour at Langford , such as he received from a gentleman who knew her perfectly well , which , if true , must raise abhorrence against her , and which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit .
His opinion of her , I am sure , was as low as of any woman in England ; and when he first came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither to delicacy nor respect , and that he felt she would be delighted with the attentions of any man inclined to flirt with her .
Her behaviour , I confess , has been calculated to do away with such an idea ; I have not detected the smallest impropriety in it -- nothing of vanity , of pretension , of levity ; and she is altogether so attractive that I should not wonder at his being delighted with her , had he known nothing of her previous to this personal acquaintance ; but , against reason , against conviction , to be so well pleased with her , as I am sure he is , does really astonish me .
This tendency to excuse her conduct or to forget it , in the warmth of admiration , vexes me ; and if I did not know that Reginald is too much at home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening his visit , I should regret Mr. Vernon 's giving him any .
Lady Susan's intentions are of course those of absolute coquetry , or a desire of universal admiration ; I can not for a moment imagine that she has anything more serious in view ; but it mortifies me to see a young man of Reginald 's sense duped by her at all .
LADY DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON
I am so much agitated by delight that I can scarcely hold a pen ; but am determined to send you a few short lines by James , that you may have some explanation of what must so greatly astonish you , as that Reginald should be returning to Parklands .
I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in the breakfast parlour , when my brother called me out of the room .
I instantly saw that something was the matter ; his complexion was raised , and he spoke with great emotion ; you know his eager manner , my dear mother , when his mind is interested .
I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or Thursday , as I shall go through London , where I have business ; but before I leave you , '' he continued , speaking in a lower tone , and with still greater energy , `` I must warn you of one thing -- do not let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin .
She is a sweet girl , and deserves a better fate .
Send him away immediately ; he is only a fool : but what her mother can mean , Heaven only knows !
I would not try to stop him , for I know what his feelings must be .
The nature of mine , as I listened to him , I need not attempt to describe ; for a minute or two I remained in the same spot , overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed ; yet it required some consideration to be tranquilly happy .
In about ten minutes after my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the room .
I replied that it was .
`` He told us nothing of all this last night , '' said she , laughing , `` or even this morning at breakfast ; but perhaps he did not know it himself .
`` His disposition , you know , is warm , and he came to expostulate with me ; his compassion all alive for this ill-used girl , this heroine in distress !
His resolution of leaving Churchhill is consistent with his general eagerness .
When I understood his intention , however , and at the same time began to think that we had been perhaps equally mistaken in each other 's meaning , I resolved to have an explanation before it was too late .
For any member of your family I must always feel a degree of affection , and I own it would have sensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so gloomily .
Excuse me , my dearest sister , for thus trespassing on your time , but I owe it to my own character ; and after this explanation I trust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion . ''
but I left her almost in silence .
It was the greatest stretch of forbearance I could practise .
but I will not allow myself to dwell on them ; they will strike you sufficiently .
I see how closely she observes him and Lady Susan , poor girl !
I have now no hope for her .
There is not a chance of her affection being returned .
The probability of their marrying is surely heightened !
When that wretched event takes place , Frederica must belong wholly to us .
I am thankful that my last letter will precede this by so little , as every moment that you can be saved from feeling a joy which leads only to disappointment is of consequence .
`` Very true , '' cried Mrs. Norris , `` which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two -- there can be no difference .
or was she puzzled about anything in her lesson that he could explain ?
He tried to console her .
`` But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ''
-- Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight .
I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is .
To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest attention .
She had not time for such cares .
Miss Lee taught her French , and heard her read the daily portion of history ; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours , he encouraged her taste , and corrected her judgment : he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read , and heightened its attraction by judicious praise .
`` There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile .
`` Well done , sister !
Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit .
If I were you , I should not think of the expense .
I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible .
Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do .
You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you .
It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre .
It would be quite a burlesque .
We were always doing something as it was .
`` When they are at a distance from all their family , '' said Fanny , colouring for William 's sake , `` they can write long letters . ''
Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . ''
`` There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford 's willingness ; but why should not more of us go ?
`` It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding ! ''
`` I never see one sit a horse better .
She did not seem to have a thought of fear .
Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good-humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , `` I must say , ma'am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ''
I can not do without Fanny . ''
The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows .
The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . ''
No objection was made , but for some time there seemed no inclination to move in any plan , or to any distance .
All were attracted at first by the plants or the pheasants , and all dispersed about in happy independence .
Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on .
The remaining three , Mrs. Rushworth , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , were still far behind ; for Julia , whose happy star no longer prevailed , was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth , and restrain her impatient feet to that lady 's slow pace , while her aunt , having fallen in with the housekeeper , who was come out to feed the pheasants , was lingering behind in gossip with her .
Poor Julia , the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot , was now in a state of complete penance , and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box as could well be imagined .
`` But why are you to be a clergyman ?
How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair 's to his own , do all that you speak of ?
govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ?
One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . ''
I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . ''
Nothing was fixed on ; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects , and , generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by Mr. Rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith 's place .
Literally , I conclude .
But unluckily that iron gate , that ha-ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship .
`` Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! ''
This was a most unjust reflection , but Fanny could allow for it , and let it pass : Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth .
There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ''
`` Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else .
Do you see no symptoms there ? ''
`` The innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . ''
`` Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character , '' cried Julia , with angry quickness : `` I am _not_ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me .
I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ''
`` There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ''
Miss Crawford talked of something else , and soon afterwards rejoined the party at the fire .
Fanny did not love Miss Crawford ; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness ; and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _she_ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again -- she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended .
`` Yes , certainly . ''
I want your opinion . ''
`` No , I can not think of anything else . ''
After all that she had heard him say , and seen him look , and known him to be feeling .
Was he not deceiving himself ?
Was he not wrong ?
She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her .
`` I dare say she is , '' replied Mary coldly .
`` I imagine both sisters are . ''
`` One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _should_ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too .
`` Am I right ?
Yes ; this is the East room .
`` Something must be done , '' said he .
It was a very proper wedding .
In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest investigation .
Mrs. Grant , really eager to get any change for her sister , could , by the easiest self-deceit , persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny , and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls .
If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them .
I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . ''
`` How differently we feel ! ''
`` To me , the sound of _Mr._ Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning , so entirely without warmth or character !
It just stands for a gentleman , and that 's all .
But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund .
It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . ''
`` Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with .
I do not mean to be poor .
`` If you put such a question to her , '' cried Edmund , preventing his cousin 's speaking , `` Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ''
She was anxious , she knew -- more anxious perhaps than she ought to be -- for what was it after all whether she went or staid ?
but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent .
Her cause , meanwhile , went on well .
`` But is it not very natural , '' observed Edmund , `` that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ''
`` Yes , ma'am , I should not think of anything else . ''
Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits .
She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re-assembled in the drawing-room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister .
`` No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ''
`` It can be but for a fortnight , '' said Henry ; `` and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save .
I want nothing more . ''
He had been in the Mediterranean ; in the West Indies ; in the Mediterranean again ; had been often taken on shore by the favour of his captain , and in the course of seven years had known every variety of danger which sea and war together could offer .
With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to ; and though Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room , and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button , in the midst of her nephew's account of a shipwreck or an engagement , everybody else was attentive ; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved , or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say , `` Dear me !
I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ''
As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's behaviour ; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker-on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character .
`` But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ''
Everybody gets made but me . ''
The hope of an opportunity , which Sir Thomas had then given , was not given to be thought of no more .
The gift was too valuable .
Fanny found herself obliged to yield , that she might not be accused of pride or indifference , or some other littleness ; and having with modest reluctance given her consent , proceeded to make the selection .
She would rather , perhaps , have been obliged to some other person .
Fanny , in great astonishment and confusion , would have returned the present instantly .
and with an eagerness and embarrassment quite diverting to her companion , she laid down the necklace again on its cotton , and seemed resolved either to take another or none at all .
Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ?
She had long seen it .
He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could .
She had never heard him speak so openly before , and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived , it was a stab , for it told of his own convictions and views .
Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be -- oh , how different would it be -- how far more tolerable !
The enthusiasm of a woman 's love is even beyond the biographer 's .
This specimen , written in haste as it was , had not a fault ; and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words , in the arrangement of `` My very dear Fanny , '' which she could have looked at for ever .
She had felt nothing like it for hours .
She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose .
She acknowledged it to be right .
Miss Crawford had a claim ; and when it was no longer to encroach on , to interfere with the stronger claims , the truer kindness of another , she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself .
The necklace really looked very well ; and Fanny left her room at last , comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her .
The gentlemen joined them ; and soon after began the sweet expectation of a carriage , when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused , and they all stood about and talked and laughed , and every moment had its pleasure and its hope .
Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening ; but Henry 's attentions had very little to do with it .
But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction .
His mind was fagged , and her happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose .
You will not want to be talked to .
`` Yes , half-past nine , '' said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving them , `` and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _me_ . ''
And in a lower tone to Fanny , `` I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from .
It is the general way all young men do . ''
A _few_ days longer , or _some_ days longer ; I am not quite sure which . ''
Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak , and Miss Crawford was disappointed ; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know , and her spirits were clouded again .
`` No , I do not , '' said Fanny softly , hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it .
`` Well , well , I am satisfied .
I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest .
wonderful , quite wonderful !
You will both find your good in it . ''
`` This is beyond me , '' said he .
`` This requires explanation .
She walked out directly , as her uncle recommended , and followed his advice throughout , as far as she could ; did check her tears ; did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind .
She wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort , and sought to regain his favour ; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion , in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts .
Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her .
How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned ; and alas !
At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome ; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits , at present or in future .
In all his niece 's family and friends , there could be but one opinion , one wish on the subject ; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way .
He staid of course , and Edmund had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny , and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners ; and it was so little , so very , very little -- every chance , every possibility of it , resting upon her embarrassment only ; if there was not hope in her confusion , there was hope in nothing else -- that he was almost ready to wonder at his friend 's perseverance .
He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer , and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before , and at , and after dinner .
Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination ; and upon this being understood , he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success ; questions , which being made , though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste , without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny , he had true pleasure in satisfying ; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered , shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before , and thought with judgment , Edmund was still more and more pleased .
This would be the way to Fanny 's heart .
Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of `` A most desirable Estate in South Wales '' ; `` To Parents and Guardians '' ; and a `` Capital season 'd Hunter . ''
He wished him to be a model of constancy ; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long .
She assented to it all rather by look than word .
How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ?
`` The Miss Owens -- you liked them , did not you ? ''
it was this sister , this friend and companion , who was now the chief bane of Fanny 's comfort .
On his side the inclination was stronger , on hers less equivocal .
It could only be imputed to increasing attachment .
His good and her bad feelings yielded to love , and such love must unite them .
She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford .
There had , in fact , been so much of message , of allusion , of recollection , so much of Mansfield in every letter , that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear ; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind , compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love , and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did , was cruelly mortifying .
Here , too , her present removal promised advantage .
When no longer under the same roof with Edmund , she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble , and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing .
They entered Oxford , but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund 's college as they passed along , and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury , where a comfortable meal , uniting dinner and supper , wound up the enjoyments and fatigues of the day .
With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her , Mr. Price now received his daughter ; and having given her a cordial hug , and observed that she was grown into a woman , and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon , seemed very much inclined to forget her again .
Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey .
At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage , he exclaimed , `` Devil take those young dogs !
Ay , Sam 's voice louder than all the rest !
There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others .
The intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to each .
Susan had read nothing , and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first pleasures , and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself .
`` I do not know .
It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ' end . ''
`` I wish you were not so tired , '' said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house -- '' I wish I left you in stronger health .
I am not satisfied about Maddison .
I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property .
I was not explicit enough with him before .
Do you advise it ? ''
She could not command her attention as she wished .
Lady Bertram's hour of good luck came .
Three or four Prices might have been swept away , any or all except Fanny and William , and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it ; or perhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris 's lips the cant of its being a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have them so well provided for .
Such was the state of Mansfield , and so it continued , with scarcely any change , till Easter .
Her eagerness , her impatience , her longings to be with them , were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper 's Tirocinium for ever before her .
They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret meditations , and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her aunt using the same language : `` I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time , so very trying to my spirits .
I trust and hope , and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again , '' were most delightful sentences to her .
Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle 's house .
There was no sign of displeasure , or even of hearing her .
They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield .
She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there .
In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul .
It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience -- conscientious as you are -- keep away , when you have the means of returning .
`` Then , there 's the devil to pay among them , that 's all !
I do n't know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less .
if she belonged to _me_ , I 'd give her the rope 's end as long as I could stand over her .
A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things . ''
The truth rushed on her ; and how she could have spoken at all , how she could even have breathed , was afterwards matter of wonder to herself .
When shall you be ready ?
It was settled that he should order the carriage to the door in half an hour .
He had already ate , and declined staying for their meal .
He would walk round the ramparts , and join them with the carriage .
He was gone again ; glad to get away even from Fanny .
That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient .
It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . ''
My Fanny , indeed , at this very time , I have the satisfaction of knowing , must have been happy in spite of everything .
She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt , or thought she felt , for the distress of those around her .
She knew it was so , and was sorry ; but it was with a sorrow so founded on satisfaction , so tending to ease , and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation , that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it .
