`` Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays , '' she remarked .
They had been conspicuous judges and admirals , lawyers and servants of the State for some years before the richness of the soil culminated in the rarest flower that any family can boast , a great writer , a poet eminent among the poets of England , a Richard Alardyce ; and having produced him , they proved once more the amazing virtues of their race by proceeding unconcernedly again with their usual task of breeding distinguished men .
They had sailed with Sir John Franklin to the North Pole , and ridden with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow , and when they were not lighthouses firmly based on rock for the guidance of their generation , they were steady , serviceable candles , illuminating the ordinary chambers of daily life .
What a wonderful head for business you 've got !
Now I shall keep this before me , and every day I shall make a little mark in my pocketbook , and on the last day of all -- let me think , what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all ?
If it were n't the winter we could take a jaunt to Italy .
`` It 's only Mr. Turner , on the floor below , '' said Mary , and she felt grateful to Mr. Turner for having alarmed Ralph , and for having given a false alarm .
There was much to be said both for and against Mr. Rodney 's paper .
Literature was a fresh garland of spring flowers , he said , in which yew-berries and the purple nightshade mingled with the various tints of the anemone ; and somehow or other this garland encircled marble brows .
He had read very badly some very beautiful quotations .
But through his manner and his confusion of language there had emerged some passion of feeling which , as he spoke , formed in the majority of the audience a little picture or an idea which each now was eager to give expression to .
Most of the people there proposed to spend their lives in the practice either of writing or painting , and merely by looking at them it could be seen that , as they listened to Mr. Purvis first , and then to Mr. Greenhalgh , they were seeing something done by these gentlemen to a possession which they thought to be their own .
The conversation lapsed , and Mary saw Katharine looking out into the room rather moodily with closed lips , the desire to talk about herself or to initiate a friendship having , apparently , left her .
When Katharine remained silent Mary was slightly embarrassed .
I 've read Webster , I 've read Ben Jonson , but I do n't think myself clever -- not exactly , at least . ''
`` Let me guess .
`` I wonder , Miss Hilbery , whether you remembered to get that picture glazed ? ''
`` You know the names of the stars , I suppose ? ''
Denham remarked , and from the tone of his voice one might have thought that he grudged Katharine the knowledge he attributed to her .
The couple in front of them kept their distance accurately , and appeared , so far as Denham could judge by the way they turned towards each other , to be talking very constantly .
Without intending to watch them he never quite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round Katharine 's head , or the light overcoat which made Rodney look fashionable among the crowd .
Among the crowd of people in the big thoroughfares Rodney seemed merely to be lending Katharine his escort , but now , when passengers were rare and the footsteps of the couple were distinctly heard in the silence , Denham could not help picturing to himself some change in their conversation .
The effect of the light and shadow , which seemed to increase their height , was to make them mysterious and significant , so that Denham had no feeling of irritation with Katharine , but rather a half-dreamy acquiescence in the course of the world .
Unconscious that they were observed , Katharine and Rodney had come out on the Embankment .
But in the presence of beauty -- look at the iridescence round the moon !
`` Do n't call that cab for me , William .
I shall walk . ''
Katharine laughed and walked on so quickly that both Rodney and the taxicab had to increase their pace to keep up with her .
`` Katharine Hilbery ? ''
`` You always make people do what you want . ''
A glow spread over her spirit , and filled her eyes with brightness .
For , as she walked along the street to her office , the force of all her customary objections to being in love with any one overcame her .
The question of tea presented itself .
Remembering Mary Datchet and her repeated invitations , she crossed the road , turned into Russell Square , and peered about , seeking for numbers with a sense of adventure that was out of all proportion to the deed itself .
But the office-boy had never heard of Miss Datchet .
Did she belong to the S.R.F.R.
Katharine shook her head with a smile of dismay .
-- top floor . ''
`` We do n't allow shop at tea , Sally , '' she said firmly .
She had given up all hope of impressing her .
`` Why do you say that 'we ' do these things ? ''
`` Mrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters , '' said Mr. Clacton , almost apologetically .
`` We have to remind her sometimes that others have a right to their views even if they differ from our own ... .
`` Punch '' has a very funny picture this week , about a Suffragist and an agricultural laborer .
`` The proofs at last ! ''
Ralph , while lifting his cup from his lips to the table , had made up his mind that if Miss Hilbery left , he would go with her .
She may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration in this fancy of hers , for she certainly did not wish to share it with Ralph .
`` But she has n't persuaded you to work for them ? ''
`` Yes , do come , '' Katharine replied .
And the man discovered I was related to the poet , and talked to me about poetry .
Even Mary Datchet seems different in that atmosphere . ''
`` No , because they do n't read it as we read it , '' Katharine insisted .
An expression which Katharine knew well from her childhood , when he asked her to shield him in some neglect of duty , came into his eyes ; malice , humor , and irresponsibility were blended in it .
He nodded his head to and fro significantly , opened the door with an adroit movement , and stepped out with a lightness unexpected at his age .
The faces of these men and women shone forth wonderfully after the hubbub of living faces , and seemed , as her mother had said , to wear a marvelous dignity and calm , as if they had ruled their kingdoms justly and deserved great love .
But she knew that she must join the present on to this past .
Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed , `` what a wicked old despot you were , in your day !
She was a mere child -- eighteen -- and half dead with fright , too .
But that old tyrant never repented .
She used to say that she had given them three perfect months , and no one had a right to more ; and I sometimes think , Katharine , that 's true , you know .
It 's more than most of us have , only we have to pretend , which was a thing neither of them could ever do .
He has a wife and children . ''
`` One could see how the poor boy had been deluded , '' was all that Mrs. Milvain vouchsafed by way of description .
`` Poor Cyril ! ''
Although she was by birth an Alardyce , and Aunt Celia a Hilbery , the complexities of the family relationship were such that each was at once first and second cousin to the other , and thus aunt and cousin to the culprit Cyril , so that his misbehavior was almost as much Cousin Caroline 's affair as Aunt Celia 's .
Cousin Caroline was a lady of very imposing height and circumference , but in spite of her size and her handsome trappings , there was something exposed and unsheltered in her expression , as if for many summers her thin red skin and hooked nose and reduplication of chins , so much resembling the profile of a cockatoo , had been bared to the weather ; she was , indeed , a single lady ; but she had , it was the habit to say , `` made a life for herself , '' and was thus entitled to be heard with respect .
`` If the train had not gone out of the station just as I arrived , I should have been with you before .
The little tug which she gave to the blind , letting it fly up to the top with a snap , signified her annoyance .
How they talked and moralized and made up stories to suit their own version of the becoming , and secretly praised their own devotion and tact !
No ; they had their dwelling in a mist , she decided ; hundreds of miles away -- away from what ?
`` Perhaps it would be better if I married William , '' she thought suddenly , and the thought appeared to loom through the mist like solid ground .
So long as that ? ''
`` My dear Katharine , '' Rodney exclaimed , `` I do n't ask you for criticism , as I should ask a scholar .
I dare say there are only five men in England whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me .
I kept asking myself , 'Now is this the sort of thing Katharine would like ? '
`` You think too much of me altogether , William , '' she said , forgetting that she had not meant to speak in this way .
Perhaps it was that no man could expect to have the most momentous question of his life settled in a voice so level , so toneless , so devoid of joy or energy .
At any rate William made no answer .
`` ... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram .
Such a nice , rich , English name , too , and , in addition , he has all the graces of intellect ; he has read literally EVERYTHING .
I tell Katharine , I shall always put him on my right side at dinner , so as to have him by me when people begin talking about characters in Shakespeare .
They wo n't be rich , but they 'll be very , very happy .
I was sitting in my room late one night , feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again , when I heard Katharine outside in the passage , and I thought to myself , 'Shall I call her in ? '
I did n't want her to marry any one ; but when she said , 'It will make no difference .
I shall always care for you and father most , ' then I saw how selfish I was , and I told her she must give him everything , everything , everything !
I told her I should be thankful to come second .
And then I thought , though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time , Katharine had said she was happy , and I should have a son , and it would all turn out so much more wonderfully than I could possibly imagine , for though the sermons do n't say so , I do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in .
Suppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already ?
he asked , smiling at the carelessness of her gesture .
His eyes were bright , and , indeed , he scarcely knew whether they beheld dreams or realities .
He summoned all the faculties of his spirit to seize what the minutes had to give him ; and from the depths of his mind there rose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that human nature surpasses , in its beauty , all that our wildest dreams bring us hints of .
Poor John , or the fool of the family , '' Mrs. Milvain hastened to inform them .
`` The other boys were so brilliant , and he could never pass his examinations , so they sent him to India -- a long voyage in those days , poor fellow .
You had your own room , you know , and you did it up .
I used to say to her father , 'She 's watching us , and summing us all up in her little mind . '
They abused her goodness , I 'm sorry to say , and while they walked in the lanes , they stood the perambulator alone in a field where there was a bull .
The animal became enraged by the red blanket in the perambulator , and Heaven knows what might have happened if a gentleman had not been walking by in the nick of time , and rescued Katharine in his arms ! ''
No regret or consciousness of wrong disturbed her .
`` I was n't thinking about my work , '' Ralph replied , rather hastily .
Could any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these statements be disturbing her ?
No one could have guessed , from the look of her , that she was disturbed at all .
A pleasanter and saner woman than Mary Datchet was never seen within a committee-room .
Mary tried half a dozen methods of ousting him .
She raised her voice , she articulated distinctly , she looked firmly at Mr. Clacton 's bald head , she began to write a note .
She looked again at Mr. Clacton ; yes , he was bald , and so are cock-sparrows .
Never was a secretary tormented by so many unsuitable suggestions , and they all came , alas !
The thought of what she might say made her bite her lips , as if her lips would protect her .
She could not bring herself to attach more weight to one project than to another .
Ralph had said -- she could not stop to consider what he had said , but he had somehow divested the proceedings of all reality .
And then , without conscious effort , by some trick of the brain , she found herself becoming interested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign .
Certain articles were to be written ; certain editors approached .
What line was it advisable to take ?
She found herself strongly disapproving of what Mr. Clacton was saying .
She committed herself to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard .
Directly she had said this , she felt that she had turned upon Ralph 's ghost ; and she became more and more in earnest , and anxious to bring the others round to her point of view .
she said , and so on .
as became her father 's daughter .
Surely Mrs. Seal must realize that Mary had been extraordinarily efficient ?
Although their views were very different , this sense united them and made them almost cordial in their manners to each other .
she asked of her own reflection in the little looking-glass which hung there .
She was not left to doubt much longer , for , on coming back into the sitting-room with the tea-things , Katharine informed her , apparently having been instructed so to do by William , of their engagement .
I picked up a lot of it from him -- it 's a way men have -- Gibbons , his name is .
And why should she read Shakespeare , since she IS Shakespeare -- Rosalind , you know , '' and he gave his queer little chuckle .
Somehow this compliment appeared very old-fashioned and almost in bad taste .
Mary actually felt herself blush , as if he had said `` the sex '' or `` the ladies . ''
So large is the church , and in particular the church tower , in comparison with the little street of cottages which compose the village , that the traveler is apt to cast his mind back to the Middle Ages , as the only time when so much piety could have been kept alive .
Such are the reflections of the superficial stranger , and his sight of the population , as it is represented by two or three men hoeing in a turnip-field , a small child carrying a jug , and a young woman shaking a piece of carpet outside her cottage door , will not lead him to see anything very much out of keeping with the Middle Ages in the village of Disham as it is to-day .
He only half understands what they say , and speaks very loud and clearly , as though , indeed , his voice had to carry through a hundred years or more before it reached them .
He would have a far better chance of understanding some dweller in Paris or Rome , Berlin or Madrid , than these countrymen of his who have lived for the last two thousand years not two hundred miles from the City of London .
`` I 've got to walk over from Disham , '' he said , and in the heart of him could not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived from making a bagman in a train believe what he himself did not believe .
For the letter , though signed by Katharine 's father , contained no invitation or warrant for thinking that Katharine herself was there ; the only fact it disclosed was that for a fortnight this address would be Mr. Hilbery's address .
He lay back in his corner and forgot the commercial traveler altogether .
The process of visualizing Katharine stopped short at the old gray manor-house ; instinct warned him that if he went much further with this process reality would soon force itself in ; he could not altogether neglect the figure of William Rodney .
Since the day when he had heard from Katharine 's lips of her engagement , he had refrained from investing his dream of her with the details of real life .
The light seemed to expand his heart .
A tall youth who accompanied her shook him by the hand , took his bag , and led the way without uttering one articulate word .
`` But would n't it be on the main road , or next door to a woman with six squalling children , who 'd always be hanging her washing out to dry across your garden ? ''
She went up the curving stairway , which represented the one attempt at ceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion , and down a narrow passage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the garden .
Knocking , she was told to come in .
A young man , Henry Otway , was reading , with his feet on the fender .
He gave the impression that he had not yet found the cause which suited his temperament .
`` Have you ever been down a coal-mine ? ''
`` Well , here you are ! ''
Both Katharine and Henry turned round very quickly and rather guiltily .
Rodney was in evening dress .
They were all silent , and the silence was acutely uncomfortable to Henry , at least .
`` But -- I get absorbed in my poetry .
Well , Katharine has n't got that .
She admires my poetry , you know , but that would n't be enough for her ? ''
Lady Otway sighed , it may be at the faded relics , and turned , with resignation , to her balls of wool , which , curiously and characteristically , were not an ivory-white , but rather a tarnished yellow-white .
She had called her niece in for a little chat .
We took the serious things of life seriously . ''
But just as she was deriving satisfaction from this thought , and was producing some of the hoarded wisdom which none of her own daughters , alas !
Then she turned her mind to what she had said .
You would find it very nice for a week or two , no doubt , '' said Lady Otway .
she continued , touching the bell .
At this Katharine shivered a little , drew up to the fire , and warmed her hands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the coal .
I 've stood eight years of it , and I 'm not going to stand it any longer .
I suppose this all seems to you mad , though ? ''
`` I began to find my life unsatisfactory , '' he started afresh .
`` Mary , '' he cried , stung by the remembrance of his exacting and dictatorial ways with her , `` what a brute I 've been to you ! ''
`` In fact , my feelings towards you seem to be utterly and damnably bad , '' he said energetically , although forced to keep his voice low .
She glanced at him with an oddly furtive expression .
`` I 'm not a fool , after all .
Katharine is quite right .
And yet those are not my serious feelings , as she knows quite well .
And yet she could speak to him like that !
In a sort of bewilderment he lost all desire to speak , and would quite readily have taken up some different topic of conversation if Katharine had started one .
This , however , she did not do .
He went on now to tell her of his love for her , in words which bore , even to her critical senses , the stamp of truth ; but none of this touched her , until , coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty , he heaved it open with his shoulder , still talking and taking no account of his effort .
`` Have n't I always been thinking of Katharine while I was with Mary ?
And this is what I 've made of my life -- nothing , nothing , nothing . ''
Mary thought that this silence was the silence of relief ; his depression she ascribed to the fact that he had seen Katharine and parted from her , leaving her in the company of William Rodney .
Strange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets should the passenger , by chance , have no exact destination in front of him , much as the mind shapes all kinds of forms , solutions , images when listening inattentively to music .
From an acute consciousness of herself as an individual , Mary passed to a conception of the scheme of things in which , as a human being , she must have her share .
She wished she had a pencil and a piece of paper to help her to give a form to this conception which composed itself as she walked down the Charing Cross Road .
But if she talked to any one , the conception might escape her .
Mary 's lips parted slightly .
`` Oh , please stay ! ''
Mary exclaimed , putting out her hand to stop her .
Directly Katharine moved she felt , inarticulately and violently , that she could not bear to let her go .
If Katharine went , her only chance of speaking was lost ; her only chance of saying something tremendously important was lost .
Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake Katharine 's attention , and put flight and further silence beyond her power .
But although the words came to her lips , her throat closed upon them and drove them back .
Because it is right , her instinct told her ; right to expose oneself without reservations to other human beings .
She flinched from the thought .
Something she must keep of her own .
The imagination of this loneliness frightened her , and yet to speak -- to lose her loneliness , for it had already become dear to her , was beyond her power .
`` I 've told you , '' she said , `` because I want you to help me .
The only way , I thought , was to tell you . ''
William Rodney , having come back earlier from the office than he expected , sat down to pick out the melodies in `` The Magic Flute '' upon the piano .
Katharine was late , but that was nothing new , and , as she had no particular liking for music , and he felt in the mood for it , perhaps it was as well .
This defect in Katharine was the more strange , William reflected , because , as a rule , the women of her family were unusually musical .
Her cousin , Cassandra Otway , for example , had a very fine taste in music , and he had charming recollections of her in a light fantastic attitude , playing the flute in the morning-room at Stogdon House .
He had lent her his play .
The dinner was brought in , and had to be set by the fire to keep hot .
Owing to the illness of one of his fellow-clerks , it was likely that he would get no holiday until later in the year , which would mean the postponement of their marriage .
He acquitted her of any wish to hurt him wantonly , but there was something in her character which made it impossible for her to help hurting people .
He tried to fit her with each of these descriptions , but he had to own that she puzzled him .
I mean the lease isn't signed , '' she replied .
What has happened ? ''
He said it in a way which struck her , at last , as oddly casual .
She looked at him .
Perhaps she was late ?
The announcement seemed to convey very little to either of his hearers .
But her agitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past .
She bent her mind to follow what Ralph was saying .
If only Ralph were not there , she would at once give way to her desire to take William 's hand , then to bend his head upon her shoulder , for this was what she wanted to do more than anything at the moment , unless , indeed , she wished more than anything to be alone -- yes , that was what she wanted .
She was sick to death of these discussions ; she shivered at the effort to reveal her feelings .
William was speaking now .
she asked at random , striking into a conversation which she had only half heard , in such a way as to make both Rodney and Denham look at her with a little surprise .
He nodded his head , and said , nervously , `` Yes , yes , '' and looked at Katharine , and thought how beautiful she looked ; there was no one in the world that he admired more .
Shall we go together ? ''
There was too much risk , also , of finding an empty cab .
He knew perfectly well what he wished to say , and had arranged not only the substance , but the order in which he was to say it .
The silence was prolonged , and at length drew her attention to him .
`` I mean every word I say , '' he replied , emphatically .
`` Ralph Denham is in love with you . ''
They came back to her in Mary Datchet 's voice .
`` If you were to know me you would feel none of this , '' she said .
she asked , recollecting the whole scene .
`` I thought that you criticized me -- perhaps disliked me .
`` No , '' she added , in a second , bethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided upon a question to which she had paid no attention , `` I do n't see how to manage it . ''
She stood looking at Denham , considering and hesitating , with her foot upon the step .
He guessed her difficulties ; he knew in a second that she had heard nothing ; he knew everything that she felt .
`` Well , that 's better than nothing , and I promise to leave you alone . ''
She made absurd excuses , as that she did not wish to cross the road , or that she was certain to pass another post-office in a more central position a little farther on .
These invisible people wished to be informed whether she was engaged to William Rodney , or was the engagement broken off ?
What did Ralph Denham mean by what he said to you last night ?
What are you going to do ?
`` I 'm hopeless without your help ! ''
When he faced her , she thought that she saw him for the first time without disguise .
`` Here she comes , like a ship in full sail , '' he said to himself , half remembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down thus with feathers flying and airs saluting her .
He rose , and she saw him ; her little exclamation proved that she was glad to find him , and then that she blamed herself for being late .
`` It 's not a thing that matters . ''
`` I mean it matters to me , but it matters to no one else .
Anyhow , '' he continued , more amiably , `` I see no reason why you should be bothered with other people 's nuisances . ''
Surely you must have found with your own family that it 's impossible to discuss what matters to you most because you 're all herded together , because you 're in a conspiracy , because the position is false -- '' Her reasoning suspended itself a little inconclusively , for the subject was complex , and she found herself in ignorance whether Denham had a family or not .
All this must be understood . ''
`` Would Rodney mind ? ''
She said nothing that jarred upon him , and untrained daring had the power to stimulate experience to such an extent that Rodney was frequently seen to hold his fork suspended before him , while he debated the first principles of the art .
`` Here 's Katharine talking about rats , and hay , and all sorts of odd things , '' she said , as William returned to them .
Mary had a ruffled appearance , as if she had been running her fingers through her hair in the course of her conversation ; she was dressed more or less like a Russian peasant girl .
She sat down again in a chair which looked as if it had been her seat for some hours ; the saucer which stood upon the arm contained the ashes of many cigarettes .
In connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor , for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class , and for a joint assault of the two bodies , combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy , upon Capital .
Her questions frequently began , `` Am I to understand -- '' and his replies invariably represented the views of some one called `` we . ''
she asked again , looking , with a little smile , at the blue silk and the pearl-sewn shoes .
Mr. Basnett asked , with a little smile .
`` Suppose , as you say , it 's out of the question -- this friendship ; he falls in love with me .
For both of them it had become one of those moments of extreme detachment , when it seems unnecessary ever again to shoulder the burden of happiness and self-assertive existence .
Their neighbors were welcome to their possessions .
The sight , unfortunately , was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind , the ruse was so transparent , that Katharine was seized with laughter .
It was not only that she was laughing at him ; the detachment of the sound was horrible .
`` Why should n't you come with me ? ''
We can go to my room afterwards . ''
The rigidity of extreme shyness came over her .
( The tray should go up if you 've done , Johnnie . )
My boy Charles is in bed with a cold .
We did try drawing-room tea , but it did n't do . ''
`` The whole house will be down one of these days , '' James muttered .
She did not apply her judgment consciously to Ralph , but when she looked at him , a moment later , she rated him lower than at any other time of their acquaintanceship .
An immense relief , and a reluctance to enjoy that relief , conflicted in her heart .
Look at me , Ralph . ''
Beauty means nothing whatever .
`` I warn you it 's the source of all evil . ''
`` When are you to be married ? ''
he asked abruptly , with a change of tone .
She would never speak to him of Rodney of her own accord , and her reserve left a whole continent of her soul in darkness .
`` It 's that I want to be where I can see you . ''
he exclaimed , with something like dismay .
Everything had become miraculously different and completely distinct .
His feelings were justified and needed no further explanation .
But he must impart them to some one , because his discovery was so important that it concerned other people too .
He had no doubt where he was going .
As he rang her bell , he seemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful that was separate from himself , and gave him power and authority over all other people .
He was perfectly silent , and in the dusk his face looked completely white .
He followed her into her room .
`` Is there anything that I could do for you ? ''
This sentence , apparently addressed to no other human being , reached Denham 's ears .
The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it directly .
`` Never -- to me . ''
`` Ah , I 've always known it , '' he cried , `` I 've known it from the first .
You 'll marry her ! ''
`` And did William send you those lovely flowers ? ''
`` People are talking about you , Katharine .
At the Markhams ' dance he sat out five dances with her .
They never came back here till seven in the evening .
But that is not all .
They say his manner is very marked -- he is quite different when she is there . ''
I think you 'd better go , Aunt Celia .
We don't understand each other . ''
Whatever divinity she prayed to , if pray she did , at any rate she recovered her dignity in a singular way and faced her niece .
`` What has she told you ? ''
`` It 's all been a mistake , '' he said .
`` I blame myself for it .
I should have known better .
Katharine burst out , not listening to him .
`` She threatened to speak to her .
She 's capable of it -- she 's capable of anything ! ''
`` She loves you , '' Katharine repeated .
Katharine had listened to this attempt at analysis with keen attention .
`` I forbid you to draw the curtain , '' she said .
She was stung with compunction .
She marveled at her own rashness in having influenced the life of another , as she had influenced Cassandra 's life .
She turned and glanced at Katharine as she had never glanced at her before .
Oh , Katharine had everything -- beauty , mind , character .
At that moment the bell of the telephone rang and Katharine went to answer it .
Cassandra , released from observation , dropped her book and clenched her hands .
`` Why did you mean Ralph Denham ?
`` I shall tear up everything too . ''
And yet , if the telephone had been miraculously connected with some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the savor of salt , Katharine could hardly have breathed in a keener sense of exhilaration .
The tendency of her spirit seemed to be in an altogether different direction ; and of a different nature .
Secretly , she was a little shaken by the evidence which the morning had supplied of her immense capacity for -- what could one call it ?
After this her mind made excursions into the dark of the air , or settled upon the surface of the sea , which could be discovered over there , or with equal unreason it returned to its couch of bracken beneath the stars of midnight , and visited the snow valleys of the moon .
These fancies would have been in no way strange , since the walls of every mind are decorated with some such tracery , but she found herself suddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardor , which became a desire to change her actual condition for something matching the conditions of her dream .
William glanced at Cassandra .
`` Goodness knows ! ''
Her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection , at this moment , would be extremely ill-judged .
He accepted a cup .
Next she asked for a slice of cake .
`` He has left Chelsea already , '' Katharine replied .
`` They 've had a message .
`` Then I 'll go , '' said Katharine .
`` There are different ways of loving , '' she murmured , half to herself , at length .
`` I 'm sure we shall find him , '' she said more gently than she had yet spoken .
`` We shall find him , '' Mary repeated .
From motives of her own Cassandra dissuaded him .
Looking back over her shoulder as she followed Ralph through the swing doors , Cassandra marveled to see how the stage was already entirely without romance .
But , she wondered , did they really cover all the seats in brown holland every night ?
`` Oh , yes .
William waited two seconds at least .
`` Look here , we must get to the bottom of this , '' he said , dropping his formal manner and addressing Rodney as if Katharine were not present .
I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion .
Visit some cheerful seaside resort , Rodney . ''
`` I suppose you have communicated with the Otways , '' he said to Rodney grimly .
`` Why do n't you sit down ? ''
He spoke gruffly , but the force of his anger was evidently spent , or some preoccupation had turned his mood to other regions .
He made his own choice , and before his daughter could protest or make her escape , she found herself being turned by the agency of Sir Walter Scott into a civilized human being .
He could not control the telephone .
Yet the thought did not disturb him so much as the strange , unpleasant , illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before .
In truth , she found an extraordinary pleasure in being thus free to talk to some one who was equally wise and equally benignant , the mother of her earliest childhood , whose silence seemed to answer questions that were never asked .
Mrs. Hilbery listened without making any remark for a considerable time .
She seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking at her daughter than by listening to her , and , if cross-examined , she would probably have given a highly inaccurate version of Ralph Denham's life-history except that he was penniless , fatherless , and lived at Highgate -- all of which was much in his favor .
Katharine 's expression changed instantly .
His only wish was to go as straightly and quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk ; but it soon appeared that Mrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by interposing various errands of her own .
Cassandra dared to offer her cheek and received his embrace .
`` Go on , '' she said .
From the heart of his darkness he spoke his thanksgiving ; from a region as far , as hidden , she answered him .
Pausing , they looked down into the river which bore its dark tide of waters , endlessly moving , beneath them .
`` Good night , '' he breathed .
Not only was she very beautiful ; she seemed also in the highest spirits .
`` Shall she go ?
Do n't you know that our belief in man 's intellect is the greatest fallacy of them all ? ''
`` Ask any journalist , schoolmaster , politician or public house keeper in the land and they will all tell you that men are much cleverer than women . ''
`` How could they help it ?
Have n't we bred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the beginning of time so that they may be clever even if they 're nothing else ?
It 's all our doing ! ''
And it 's intellect , '' she continued , `` that 's at the bottom of it .
Every day he goes to an office .
Every year he produces a book .
Soon he can not come into a room without making us all feel uncomfortable ; he condescends to every woman he meets , and dares not tell the truth even to his own wife ; instead of rejoicing our eyes we have to shut them if we are to take him in our arms .
True , they console themselves with stars of all shapes , ribbons of all shades , and incomes of all sizes -- but what is to console us ?
Oh , Cassandra , for Heaven 's sake let us devise a method by which men may bear children !
The _Times_ was no protection against such sorrow as hers .
The best thing to do against life was to fold the paper so that it made a perfect square , crisp , thick , impervious even to life .
She pierced through my shield ; she gazed into my eyes as if searching any sediment of courage at the depths of them and damping it to clay .
Her twitch alone denied all hope , discounted all illusion .
Slowly the knives and forks sink from the upright .
`` Get on with your pudding , Bob ; '' but Hilda disapproves .
little bedroom looking out over the roofs of Eastbourne -- zigzagging roofs like the spines of caterpillars , this way , that way , striped red and yellow , with blue-black slating ] .
The looking-glass -- no , you avoid the looking-glass .
Perhaps the shell box has something in it ?
And then the sniff , the sigh , the sitting by the window .
That gives her nothing to look at .
Yes , sitting on the very edge of the chair looking over the roofs of Eastbourne , Minnie Marsh prays to God .
Who 's the God of Minnie Marsh , the God of the back streets of Eastbourne , the God of three o'clock in the afternoon ?
What she rubs on the window is the stain of sin .
Oh , she committed some crime !
white , worn , the mouth closed -- a touch of obstinacy , more than one would think -- no hint of sex ) -- so many crimes are n't _your_ crime ; your crime was cheap ; only the retribution solemn ; for now the church door opens , the hard wooden pew receives her ; on the brown tiles she kneels ; every day , winter , summer , dusk , dawn ( here she 's at it ) prays .
And John at breakfast -- the children -- meals are worst , and sometimes there are friends -- ferns don't altogether hide 'em -- they guess , too ; so out you go along the front , where the waves are grey , and the papers blow , and the glass shelters green and draughty , and the chairs cost tuppence -- too much -- for there must be preachers along the sands .
Ah , that 's a nigger -- that 's a funny man -- that 's a man with parakeets -- poor little creatures !
-- just up there , over the pier , with his rod -- but no -- there 's nothing but grey in the sky or if it 's blue the white clouds hide him , and the music -- it 's military music -- and what they are fishing for ?
The words have meaning ; might have been spoken by the old man with whiskers -- no , no , he did n't really speak ; but everything has meaning -- placards leaning against doorways -- names above shop-windows -- red fruit in baskets -- women 's heads in the hairdresser 's -- all say `` Minnie Marsh ! ''
`` Eggs are cheaper ! ''
I was heading her over the waterfall , straight for madness , when , like a flock of dream sheep , she turns t'other way and runs between my fingers .
She opened the door , and , putting her umbrella in the stand -- that goes without saying ; so , too , the whiff of beef from the basement ; dot , dot , dot .
Moreover , I feel , pleasantly pricking through the green fretwork and over the glacis of cut glass , a desire to peer and peep at the man opposite -- one 's as much as I can manage .
James Moggridge is it , whom the Marshes call Jimmy ?
Well , the family boots are mended on Sundays by James himself .
How many die in every novel that 's written -- the best , the dearest , while Moggridge lives .
-- there must be Jimmy -- or what 's her twitch for ?
No , for I assure you I come willingly ; I come wooed by Heaven knows what compulsion across ferns and cruets , table splashed and bottles smeared .
The enormous stability of the fabric ; the spine tough as whalebone , straight as oak-tree ; the ribs radiating branches ; the flesh taut tarpaulin ; the red hollows ; the suck and regurgitation of the heart ; while from above meat falls in brown cubes and beer gushes to be churned to blood again -- and so we reach the eyes .
`` Marsh would know what 's wrong with Morrises ... '' talk that over ; cheese has come ; the plate again ; turn it round -- the enormous fingers ; now the woman opposite .
Not what _I_ said ?
A strange young man ... .
What do I know ?
The melancholy river bears us on .
When the moon comes through the trailing willow boughs , I see your face , I hear your voice and the bird singing as we pass the osier bed .
`` Then these are the embraces of our souls . ''
The lemons nod assent .
`` For me , a square silver shoe buckle and a dragonfly -- ''
The elder man had a curiously uneven and shaky method of walking , jerking his hand forward and throwing up his head abruptly , rather in the manner of an impatient carriage horse tired of waiting outside a house ; but in the man these gestures were irresolute and pointless .
`` Think of the fairies , '' said Betty Flanders .
Now shut your eyes and see the old mother bird with a worm in her beak .
`` What 's all that water rushing in ? ''
whispered Rebecca , looking at the cot .
There was a click in the front sitting-room .
Every inch was rained upon .
But Morris is sometimes wrong .
`` How you frightened me ! ''
She thought something dreadful had happened .
And Mrs. Jarvis walked on alone .
Probably the same thoughts again and again .
Therefore we must cherish this man .
`` Oh , Captain , '' said Mrs. Flanders , bursting into the drawing-room , `` I had to run after Barker 's man ...
I hope Jacob ... ''
Mrs. Flanders exclaimed , looking the Captain full in the face .
Taking note of socks ( loose ) , of tie ( shabby ) , she once more reached his face .
The eyes bent down , since he was reading .
She looked out of the window , smiling slightly now , and then came back again , for he didn't notice her .
Grave , unconscious ... now he looked up , past her ... he seemed so out of place , somehow , alone with an elderly lady ... then he fixed his eyes -- which were blue -- on the landscape .
He had not realized her presence , she thought .
Yet it was none of HER fault that this was not a smoking-carriage -- if that was what he meant .
One must do the best one can with her report .
Anyhow , this was Jacob Flanders , aged nineteen .
It is no use trying to sum people up .
One must follow hints , not exactly what is said , nor yet entirely what is done -- for instance , when the train drew into the station , Mr. Flanders burst open the door , and put the lady 's dressing-case out for her , saying , or rather mumbling : `` Let me '' very shyly ; indeed he was rather clumsy about it .
Jacob determined , of course , that he would eat his meat in the time it took her to finish her cabbage , looking once or twice to measure his speed -- only he was infernally hungry .
Seeing this , Mrs. Plumer said that she was sure Mr. Flanders would not mind -- and the tart was brought in .
Nodding in a peculiar way , she directed the maid to give Mr. Flanders a second helping of mutton .
Not much of the leg would be left for luncheon .
Anyhow , whether undergraduate or shop boy , man or woman , it must come as a shock about the age of twenty -- the world of the elderly -- thrown up in such black outline upon what we are ; upon the reality ; the moors and Byron ; the sea and the lighthouse ; the sheep 's jaw with the yellow teeth in it ; upon the obstinate irrepressible conviction which makes youth so intolerably disagreeable -- '' I am what I am , and intend to be it , '' for which there will be no form in the world unless Jacob makes one for himself .
The Plumers will try to prevent him from making it .
Wells and Shaw and the serious sixpenny weeklies will sit on its head .
And the river too runs past , not at flood , nor swiftly , but cloying the oar that dips in it and drops white drops from the blade , swimming green and deep over the bowed rushes , as if lavishly caressing them .
The feathery white moon never let the sky grow dark ; all night the chestnut blossoms were white in the green ; dim was the cow-parsley in the meadows .
It is not simple , or pure , or wholly splendid , the lamp of learning , since if you see them there under its light ( whether Rossetti 's on the wall , or Van Gogh reproduced , whether there are lilacs in the bowl or rusty pipes ) , how priestly they look !
Old Professor Huxtable , performing with the method of a clock his change of dress , let himself down into his chair ; filled his pipe ; chose his paper ; crossed his feet ; and extracted his glasses .
Yet strip a whole seat of an underground railway carriage of its heads and old Huxtable 's head will hold them all .
Such a muster takes place in no other brain .
Yet sometimes there he 'll sit for hours together , gripping the arm of the chair , like a man holding fast because stranded , and then , just because his corn twinges , or it may be the gout , what execrations , and , dear me , to hear him talk of money , taking out his leather purse and grudging even the smallest silver coin , secretive and suspicious as an old peasant woman with all her lies .
Serene over it all rides the great full brow , and sometimes asleep or in the quiet spaces of the night you might fancy that on a pillow of stone he lay triumphant .
Oh , it was Simeon .
Without need of movement or speech it rose softly and washed over everything , mollifying , kindling , and coating the mind with the lustre of pearl , so that if you talk of a light , of Cambridge burning , it 's not languages only .
Timmy laughed so much that he could not speak .
As for the bee , having sucked its fill of honey , it visited the teasle and thence made a straight line to Mrs. Pascoe 's patch , once more directing the tourists ' gaze to the old woman 's print dress and white apron , for she had come to the door of the cottage and was standing there .
`` We put it to you , Mrs. Durrant , '' said a young man with thick spectacles and a fiery moustache .
All passed out at the open door .
Mrs. Durrant turned and walked away by herself .
The motor omnibuses were locked .
Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound for Shepherd's Bush .
Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart ; and his friends could only read the title , James Spalding , or Charles Budgeon , and the passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all -- save `` a man with a red moustache , '' `` a young man in grey smoking a pipe . ''
Beauty , in its hothouse variety ( which is none of the worst ) , flowered in box after box ; and though nothing was said of profound importance , and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted beautiful lips about the time that Walpole died -- at any rate when Victoria in her nightgown descended to meet her ministers , the lips ( through an opera glass ) remained red , adorable .
Bald distinguished men with gold-headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between the stalls , and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when the lights went down , and the conductor , first bowing to the Queen , next to the bald-headed men , swept round on his feet and raised his wand .
Lying back in his chair , taking his pipe from his lips , and saying to Bonamy : `` About this opera now '' ( for they had done with indecency ) .
One word is sufficient .
Such the conditions of our love .
It 's nearly the end of October .
One must apply oneself to something or other -- God knows what .
Everything is really very jolly -- except getting up in the morning and wearing a tail coat . ''
Jacob took her word for it that she was chaste .
The tomb of her father was mentioned .
Out she swept , the black woman with the dancing feather in her hat .
`` There are so many ... '' Miss Eliot replied .
Three young men stood at the doorway looking about for their hostess .
`` But I do , '' said Lady Hibbert .
`` Are you fond of music ? ''
`` I daresay you were never taught .
Why is that , Sir Jasper ?
-- Sir Jasper Bigham -- Mr. Flanders .
Then , sometimes a game of chess ; or pictures in Bond Street , or a long way home to take the air with Bonamy on his arm , meditatively marching , head thrown back , the world a spectacle , the early moon above the steeples coming in for praise , the sea-gulls flying high , Nelson on his column surveying the horizon , and the world our ship .
Ah , but where are you going if instead of brushing past the old man with the white beard , the silver medal , and the cheap violin , you let him go on with his story , which ends in an invitation to step somewhere , to his room , presumably , off Queen 's Square , and there he shows you a collection of birds ' eggs and a letter from the Prince of Wales 's secretary , and this ( skipping the intermediate stages ) brings you one winter 's day to the Essex coast , where the little boat makes off to the ship , and the ship sails and you behold on the skyline the Azores ; and the flamingoes rise ; and there you sit on the verge of the marsh drinking rum-punch , an outcast from civilization , for you have committed a crime , are infected with yellow fever as likely as not , and -- fill in the sketch as you like .
As frequent as street corners in Holborn are these chasms in the continuity of our ways .
Yet we keep straight on .
Rose Shaw , talking in rather an emotional manner to Mr. Bowley at Mrs. Durrant 's evening party a few nights back , said that life was wicked because a man called Jimmy refused to marry a woman called ( if memory serves ) Helen Aitken .
`` Lady Firtlemere 's carriage , my lady , '' which reminded her to send a card to ask after his lordship 's health .
She talked of Joseph Chamberlain , whom she had known .
And the Lady Alice came in with three dogs on a leash , and Jackie , who ran to kiss his grandmother , while Boxall brought in a telegram , and Jacob was given a good cigar .
`` To-morrow 's breakfast , sir , '' she said , opening the door ; and there were Sanders and Bonamy like two bulls of Bashan driving each other up and down , making such a racket , and all them chairs in the way .
Only Madame herself seeing Jacob out had about her that leer , that lewdness , that quake of the surface ( visible in the eyes chiefly ) , which threatens to spill the whole bag of ordure , with difficulty held together , over the pavement .
That was her argument .
Build a better one .
For which purpose one most collate editions in the British Museum .
Useless to trust to the Victorians , who disembowel , or to the living , who are mere publicists .
The flesh and blood of the future depends entirely upon six young men .
Grey-haired Mrs. Keymer asked Dick Graves to tell her who Mangin was , and said that she had seen too much of this sort of thing in Paris ( Magdalen had got upon his knees ; now his pipe was in her mouth ) to be shocked .
she said , staying her glasses when they came to Jacob , for indeed he looked quiet , not indifferent , but like some one on a beach , watching .
How exquisite it was -- that dress in Evelina 's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue !
It was four o'clock on a fine day early in April , and was Fanny the one to spend four o'clock on a fine day indoors ?
There was her face .
And finally under the arc lamps in the Gare des Invalides , with one of those queer movements which are so slight yet so definite , which may wound or pass unnoticed but generally inflict a good deal of discomfort , Jinny and Cruttendon drew together ; Jacob stood apart .
Something must be said .
A man wheeled a trolley past Jacob 's legs so near that he almost grazed them .
When Jacob recovered his balance the other two were turning away , though Jinny looked over her shoulder , and Cruttendon , waving his hand , disappeared like the very great genius that he was .
`` They are at rest , '' said Mrs. Jarvis .
The moors accept all that too .
It is a strange reflection that by travelling two days and nights you are in the heart of Italy .
Black victorias drive in between pompous pillars with plaster shields stuck to them .
It is at once momentary and astonishingly intimate -- to be displayed before the eyes of a foreigner .
Aristotle , a dirty man , carnivorously interested in the body of the only guest now occupying the only arm-chair , came into the room ostentatiously , put something down , put something straight , and saw that Jacob was still there .
There he saw three Greeks in kilts ; the masts of ships ; idle or busy people of the lower classes strolling or stepping out briskly , or falling into groups and gesticulating with their hands .
And as he spoke the door opened and in came a young man in a grey check suit .
The wild red cyclamen was out ; he had seen the little tortoises hobbling from clump to clump ; the air smelt strong and suddenly sweet , and the sun , striking on jagged splinters of marble , was very dazzling to the eyes .
Composed , commanding , contemptuous , a little melancholy , and bored with an august kind of boredom , there he sat smoking his pipe .
`` Here is a fellow , '' thought Evan Williams , `` who might do very well in politics . ''
There they are again , the pillars , the pediment , the Temple of Victory and the Erechtheum , set on a tawny rock cleft with shadows , directly you unlatch your shutters in the morning and , leaning out , hear the clatter , the clamour , the whip cracking in the street below .
Added to this , compared with the blistered stucco , the new love songs rasped out to the strum of guitar and gramophone , and the mobile yet insignificant faces of the street , the Parthenon is really astonishing in its silent composure ; which is so vigorous that , far from being decayed , the Parthenon appears , on the contrary , likely to outlast the entire world .
Jacob read on again .
And laying the book on the ground he began , as if inspired by what he had read , to write a note upon the importance of history -- upon democracy -- one of those scribbles upon which the work of a lifetime may be based ; or again , it falls out of a book twenty years later , and one ca n't remember a word of it .
It is a little painful .
said old General Gibbons , looking round the drawing-room , full as usual on Sunday afternoons of well-dressed people .
`` Where are the guns ? ''
There were the little tables set out at intervals on the scarlet floor with the Greek King 's monogram wrought in yellow .
Evan looked this way and that over his shoulder ; imperturbable yet supple ; and sometimes sighed .
For they were English people come together in Athens on a May evening .
Jacob never asked himself any such questions , to judge by the way he laced his boots ; shaved himself ; to judge by the depth of his sleep that night , with the wind fidgeting at the shutters , and half-a-dozen mosquitoes singing in his ears .
Already he had marked the things he liked in Donne , and they were savage enough .
`` The height of civilization , '' said Jacob .
And why was the pebble so emphatically ground in at the corner ?
Miss Thomas , one of the typists , said to her friend that if the Cabinet was going to sit much longer she should miss her boy outside the Gaiety .
Timmy Durrant , returning with his Blue book under his arm , noticed a little knot of people at the street corner ; conglomerated as though one of them knew something ; and the others , pressing round him , looked up , looked down , looked along the street .
`` Such a sunset , '' wrote Mrs. Flanders in her letter to Archer at Singapore .
`` I gave him Byron 's works , '' Andrew Floyd mused , and started forward , as Jacob crossed the road ; but hesitated , and let the moment pass , and lost the opportunity .
Carriages , with dowagers in amethyst and gentlemen spotted with carnations , intercepted cabs and motor-cars turned in the opposite direction , in which jaded men in white waistcoats lolled , on their way home to shrubberies and billiard-rooms in Putney and Wimbledon .
The eighteenth century has its distinction .
Even the panels , painted in raspberry-coloured paint , have their distinction .
`` Draughts , '' he said , erecting the collar of his coat .
`` I should suppose not , '' said Ridley significantly .
`` Perhaps -- ? ''
`` My shoulder blades ? ''
`` Beauty has no effect upon uric acid that I 'm aware of , '' he sighed , contemplating the round pane opposite , through which the sky and sea showed blue .
As it was clear that he invited comment , Helen asked him the name of it .
She got the name ; but she got also a disquisition upon the proper method of making roads .
A very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon , scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of Paris , which nevertheless rested upon it .
They were free of roads , free of mankind , and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all .
They went a few paces and Rachel saw them kiss .
While it was slightly disturbed on the surface by the passage of the _Euphrosyne_ , beneath it was green and dim , and it grew dimmer and dimmer until the sand at the bottom was only a pale blur .
`` How ever we 're to get through this voyage , Miss Rachel , I really can't tell , '' she began with a shake of her head .
`` There 's only just sheets enough to go round , and the master 's has a rotten place you could put your fingers through .
I thought to myself a poor person would have been ashamed of them .
Why , if one sewed one 's finger to the bone , one would have one's work undone the next time they went to the laundry . ''
Mrs. Chailey handled the sheets as if she knew each by name , character , and constitution .
`` Mothers always exaggerate , '' said Ridley .
You just wrap 'em up warm and put 'em in the rack . ''
You 're hindering me , and you 're doing no good to yourself . '
`` I may be treading on dangerous ground ; but what I feel about poets and artists in general is this : on your own lines , you ca n't be beaten -- granted ; but off your own lines -- puff -- one has to make allowances .
This roused Ridley 's attention .
`` But you will play to us ? ''
Instead of letting her mouth droop , dropping all her clothes in a bunch as though they depended on one string , and stretching her limbs to the utmost end of her berth , she merely changed her dress for a dressing-gown , with innumerable frills , and wrapping her feet in a rug , sat down with a writing-pad on her knee .
Evidently not an inch of her person lacked its proper instrument .
The scent which had intoxicated Rachel pervaded the air .
Thus established , Mrs. Dalloway began to write .
`` You 've let yourself in for the Greek alphabet , anyhow . ''
`` He was a Skye terrier , one of those long chaps , with little feet poking out from their hair like -- like caterpillars -- no , like sofas I should say .
Well , we had another dog at the same time , a black brisk animal -- a Schipperke , I think , you call them .
The Skye so slow and deliberate , looking up at you like some old gentleman in the club , as much as to say , 'You don't really mean it , do you ? '
I liked the Skye best , I must confess .
There was something pathetic about him . ''
But Clarissa at her end of the table had overheard .
`` One person has a passion for black beetles ; another has n't ; it 's no good arguing about it .
What 's _your_ black beetle now ? ''
`` Do tell me about the Ambroses .
Or am I asking too many questions ? ''
When a name has dropped out of use , the lightest touch upon it tells .
`` I know , '' she said , actually putting one arm round Rachel 's shoulder .
No one understood until I met Richard .
He 's man and woman as well . ''
Her eyes rested upon Mr. Dalloway , leaning upon the rail , still talking .
she exclaimed , and a tear slid down her cheek .
`` Produce your instances , Miss Vinrace , '' he went on , joining his finger-tips .
`` I 'm ready to be converted . ''
A bell chimed behind them , and Richard raised his head .
`` When you were walking ? ''
He thought it broadening to the mind .
We thought ourselves very wise .
He felt himself a man undoubtedly in the prime of life .
For a second he could not see what the body was he had run into .
`` You see , '' she said , `` you must take things as they are ; and if you want friendship with men you must run risks .
Personally , '' she continued , breaking into a smile , `` I think it 's worth it ; I do n't mind being kissed ; I 'm rather jealous , I believe , that Mr. Dalloway kissed you and did n't kiss me .
Her conclusion was that she would very much like to show her niece , if it were possible , how to live , or as she put it , how to be a reasonable person .
She thought that there must be something wrong in this confusion between politics and kissing politicians , and that an elder person ought to be able to help .
That fact , together with other facts , had been made clear by their twenty minutes ' talk , although how they had come to these conclusions they could not have said .
The movement in search of something new was of course infinitely small , affecting only a handful of well-to-do people .
The country itself taxed all their powers of description , for they said it was much bigger than Italy , and really nobler than Greece .
The place seemed new and full of new forms of beauty , in proof of which they showed handkerchiefs which the women had worn round their heads , and primitive carvings coloured bright greens and blues .
Oddly enough it happened that the least satisfactory of Helen Ambrose's brothers had been sent out years before to make his fortune , at any rate to keep clear of race-horses , in the very spot which had now become so popular .
Having at length earned enough to take a holiday , and being sick of the place , he proposed to put his villa , on the slope of the mountain , at his sister 's disposal .
Mrs. Ambrose was writing a very long letter .
Beginning `` Dear Bernard , '' it went on to describe what had been happening in the Villa San Gervasio during the past three months , as , for instance , that they had had the British Consul to dinner , and had been taken over a Spanish man-of-war , and had seen a great many processions and religious festivals , which were so beautiful that Mrs. Ambrose could n't conceive why , if people must have a religion , they did n't all become Roman Catholics .
The earth , instead of being brown , was red , purple , green .
She adopted , indeed , a condescending tone towards that poor island , which was now advancing chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks , in copses , in cosy corners , tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers , who were always touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously .
She went on to deride the islanders themselves .
Or bought his best work ?
Why are you all so ugly and so servile ?
Here the servants are human beings .
Helen sauntered on , observing the different people in their shabby clothes , who seemed so careless and so natural , with satisfaction .
He appeared to be rather stout , and had a thick crop of hair .
`` Two women , '' it said .
`` I wonder if this is what they call an ingrowing toe-nail ? ''
`` I flit from branch to branch , '' continued Hewet .
`` I always envy any one who lives in such an excessively flat country , '' she remarked .
`` I shall be out of it anyway , '' Mr. Thornbury interrupted peevishly .
Finally the old lady was placed so that the light wavered over her , as though she were a fish in a net .
`` My aunt -- '' Susan began .
`` We 're thirsting for tea , '' said Mr. Elliot .
I was sitting on a rock thinking of nothing at all when Elliot started up like a fairy in a pantomime . ''
`` I often wish I had !
`` His initials being R. S. T. , we call him Monk , '' said Hirst .
`` These little donkeys stand anything , _n'est-ce_ _pas_ ? ''
`` And Hirst could n't describe you , '' said Hewet .
`` Dear old fellow , '' said Arthur who , now that the first shock was over , was relaxing into an enormous sense of pleasure and contentment .
`` Ca n't you remember as a child chopping up hay -- '' she spoke much more quickly than usual , and kept her eye fixed upon Mrs. Thornbury , `` and pretending it was tea , and getting scolded by the nurses -- why I ca n't imagine , except that nurses are such brutes , won't allow pepper instead of salt though there 's no earthly harm in it .
`` We are suffering the tortures of the damned , '' said Helen .
She stood in the middle of the pale square of light which the window she had opened threw upon the grass .
They had been pacing up and down the terrace while they talked , and now one by one the dark windows were uncurtained by an invisible hand , and panes of light fell regularly at equal intervals upon the grass .
`` A sister-in-law , who lives at Norwich , tells me it has been quite unsafe to order poultry .
The plague -- you see .
Consider the minds of those people -- their feelings .
Do n't you agree ? ''
`` And so you 've changed your view of life , Rachel ? ''
`` What is it to be in love ? ''
She spoke reflectively , looking out into the dark garden , and thinking evidently as much of the look of the night as of what she was saying .
`` I 've cared for heaps of people , but not to marry them , '' she said .
All my life I 've wanted somebody I could look up to , somebody great and big and splendid .
Most men are so small . ''
`` But even his pictures will become old , '' Mrs. Thornbury intervened .
`` Whenever I get at all run down I tend to be rheumatic , '' Hirst stated .
`` Yes , it 's too hot , '' Helen decided .
She did not include Hewet in this criticism ; she was thinking of the clever , honest , interesting young men she knew , of whom Hirst was a good example , and wondering whether it was necessary that thought and scholarship should thus maltreat their bodies , and should thus elevate their minds to a very high tower from which the human race appeared to them like rats and mice squirming on the flat .
Hewet 's thoughts had followed some such course as this , for the first thing he said as they stood on the edge of the cliff was --
It was a body with the angles and hollows of a young woman 's body not yet developed , but in no way distorted , and thus interesting and even lovable .
`` Partly because you 're a woman , '' he replied .
Now they were out on the road and could walk side by side .
By degrees there was established a kind of correspondence between the two houses , the big and the small , so that at most hours of the day one house could guess what was going on in the other , and the words `` the villa '' and `` the hotel '' called up the idea of two separate systems of life .
One night when the moon was round between the trees , Evelyn M. told Helen the story of her life , and claimed her everlasting friendship ; or another occasion , merely because of a sigh , or a pause , or a word thoughtlessly dropped , poor Mrs. Elliot left the villa half in tears , vowing never again to meet the cold and scornful woman who had insulted her , and in truth , meet again they never did .
Meanwhile Hirst took out an envelope and began scribbling on the back of it .
When Mr. Bax mounted the pulpit he shut up Sappho with his envelope between the pages , settled his spectacles , and fixed his gaze intently upon the clergyman .
The room , of course , was one of the largest and most luxurious in the hotel .
Mrs. Flushing rang her bell violently .
`` My dear Hewet , do you wish us both to be flung out of the hotel by an enraged mob of Thornburys and Elliots ? ''
What 's the good of it ?
he exclaimed , in exultation at the thought of her , `` and I 'd keep you free .
We 'd share everything together .
`` That 's my mother , '' said Evelyn , who remained sitting on the floor binding her knees together with her arms , and watching Rachel curiously .
Rachel considered the portrait .
The second photograph represented a handsome soldier with high regular features and a heavy black moustache ; his hand rested on the hilt of his sword ; there was a decided likeness between him and Evelyn .
She repeated it more loudly still .
Mrs. Paley did not hear .
She was apparently about to repeat it for the fourth time , when Rachel suddenly said something inarticulate , and disappeared down the corridor .
It had been miserable from start to finish ; first , the service in the chapel ; then luncheon ; then Evelyn ; then Miss Allan ; then old Mrs. Paley blocking up the passage .
She disliked the look of it immensely -- churches , politicians , misfits , and huge impostures -- men like Mr. Dalloway , men like Mr. Bax , Evelyn and her chatter , Mrs. Paley blocking up the passage .
Meanwhile the steady beat of her own pulse represented the hot current of feeling that ran down beneath ; beating , struggling , fretting .
What were they doing , those other people in the world ?
She was talking vehemently to Helen across the table .
Rachel suddenly took a violent dislike to Susan , ignoring all that was kindly , modest , and even pathetic about her .
She appeared insincere and cruel ; she saw her grown stout and prolific , the kind blue eyes now shallow and watery , the bloom of the cheeks congealed to a network of dry red canals .
The gentlemen , having smoked a certain number of cigarettes , dropped the glowing ends into the river , and looked for a time at the ripples wrinkling the black water beneath them , undressed too , and lay down at the other end of the boat .
They were very tired , and curtained from each other by the darkness .
The light from one lantern fell upon a few ropes , a few planks of the deck , and the rail of the boat , but beyond that there was unbroken darkness , no light reached their faces , or the trees which were massed on the sides of the river .
By degrees as the river narrowed , and the high sandbanks fell to level ground thickly grown with trees , the sounds of the forest could be heard .
Once Mr. Flushing rose and spoke to a sailor , and even announced that some time after luncheon the steamer would stop , and they could walk a little way through the forest .
He was silent for a moment .
`` We are happy together . ''
He did not seem to be speaking , or she to be hearing .
They found themselves again in the broad path , like the drive in the English forest , where they had started when they left the others .
Whatever the thoughts of the others , no one said anything for a considerable space .
Indeed no change could have been greater .
The change of scene naturally suggested a change of position , grateful to most of them .
They rose and leant over the rail .
Apparently it was not anything unusual that had happened ; it was that they had become engaged to marry each other .
The world , which consisted for the most part of the hotel and the villa , expressed itself glad on the whole that two people should marry , and allowed them to see that they were not expected to take part in the work which has to be done in order that the world shall go on , but might absent themselves for a time .
They would talk of such questions among books , or out in the sun , or sitting in the shade of a tree undisturbed .
`` 'Again , it 's the fashion now to say that women are more practical and less idealistic than men , also that they have considerable organising ability but no sense of honour ' -- query , what is meant by masculine term , honour ?
`` God , Rachel , you do read trash ! ''
`` And you 're behind the times too , my dear .
No one dreams of reading this kind of thing now -- antiquated problem plays , harrowing descriptions of life in the east end -- oh , no , we 've exploded all that .
`` Rachel -- what a lie -- did n't you sit here looking at my window -- didn't you wander about the hotel like an owl in the sun -- ? ''
For a considerable time nothing was to be heard but the ticking of the clock and the fitful scratch of Rachel 's pen , as she produced phrases which bore a considerable likeness to those which she had condemned .
She then finished her sentence , which was awkward and ugly , and stated that they were `` both very happy , and going to be married in the autumn probably and hope to live in London , where we hope you will come and see us when we get back . ''
`` Well , then , what will it be like when we 're married ?
What are the things people do feel ? ''
He told her not only what had happened , but what he had thought and felt , and sketched for her portraits which fascinated her of what other men and women might be supposed to be thinking and feeling , so that she became very anxious to go back to England , which was full of people , where she could merely stand in the streets and look at them .
According to him , too , there was an order , a pattern which made life reasonable , or if that word was foolish , made it of deep interest anyhow , for sometimes it seemed possible to understand why things happened as they did .
She should look for vanity -- for vanity was a common quality -- first in herself , and then in Helen , in Ridley , in St. John , they all had their share of it -- and she would find it in ten people out of every twelve she met ; and once linked together by one such tie she would find them not separate and formidable , but practically indistinguishable , and she would come to love them when she found that they were like herself .
As if they stood on the edge of a precipice they clung together .
They lapsed into silence , and after a time crept together in silence .
When they appeared , St. John explained why it had been necessary for him to come to luncheon .
`` Still , '' he added , `` it 's a great shame , poor woman ; only I do n't see what 's to be done -- ''
They sat down , therefore , in the shady hall , which was almost empty , and full of the light swishing sounds of air going to and fro in a large empty space .
Her gaze rested benevolently upon them both , and , after a momentary pause , she remarked , looking at Rachel as if she had remembered something that would serve to keep her distinct from other people .
She stood talking to them at the gate for a long time ; she seemed reluctant that they should go .
On going into her room , which was not very dark , where the music was lying about as usual , and her books and letters , his spirits rose instantly .
When he saw her he felt completely reassured .
Involved in this long dreary nightmare , he did not attempt to think what it amounted to .
Confusion covered every sight and person , and he seemed to see St. John , Ridley , and the stray people who came up now and then from the hotel to enquire , through a mist ; the only people who were not hidden in this mist were Helen and Rodriguez , because they could tell him something definite about Rachel .
Hewet stood firmly between him and the door .
`` Do n't be a fool , Terence , '' he said .
`` You 'll only get ill if you don't sleep . ''
He was very uncomfortable downstairs , and , as he did not know what was going on , constantly in the way ; but he would not leave the drawing-room .
`` Why , '' he said , in his ordinary tone of voice , `` look at the moon .
There 's a halo round the moon .
The two women looked at each other with a quiet significant gaze , and then , feeling oddly dazed , and seeking she did not know exactly what , Mrs. Thornbury went slowly upstairs and walked quietly along the passages , touching the wall with her fingers as if to guide herself .
She did not even look up directly when Evelyn stopped her .
She hated death ; she was furious , outraged , indignant with death , as if it were a living creature .
She sat still at last , but she did not submit .
In the next room , meanwhile , Wilfrid was talking to Mrs. Thornbury with greater freedom now that his wife was not sitting there .
Oh , yes , I do , '' he answered awkwardly , but with obvious sincerity .
`` I know very well that I am not -- that I have not much to offer you either in myself or in my circumstances .
My friendship with Arthur was the most important thing in my life .
`` Do you really believe there 's life in Mars ? ''
Some one who knows ?
D'you know a man called -- ? ''
Here Mrs. Thornbury laid down her knitting , and a look of extreme solicitude came into her eyes .
`` Lightning again ! ''
