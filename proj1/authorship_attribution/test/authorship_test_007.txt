Too , there was always the spirit of Tom Sawyer deviltry in Mark 's make-up that prompted him , as he himself boasted , to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world .
Ball 's original , it was said , looked like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed , and may indeed have been a proof pulled in some newspaper office .
Field had a perfect genius for that sort of thing , as many extant specimens attest , and for that sort of practical joke ; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too mellow -- not hard and bright and bitter -- to be Eugene Field 's . ''
I hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings . ''
1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the Clemens family had retreated to Quarry Farm in Elmira County , New York .
Before the close of the same year he had already begun work on 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ' , published in 1885 .
It is interesting to note the use of the title , the `` Duke of Bilgewater , '' in Huck Finn when the `` Duchess of Bilgewater '' had already made her appearance in 1601 .
Sandwiched between his two great masterpieces , Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn , the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude .
During this prolific period Mark wrote many minor items , most of them rejected by Howells , and read extensively in one of his favorite books , Pepys ' Diary .
Twichell was a man of about Mark 's own age , a profound scholar , a devout Christian , `` yet a man with an exuberant sense of humor , and a profound understanding of the frailties of mankind . ''
`` Joe '' Twichell , for whose delectation the piece had been written , apparently had pocketed the document for four long years .
Dear Gunn : Are you in Cleveland for all this week ?
If you will say yes by return mail , I have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only in my hands for a few days .
But the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic .
I send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics , who know a good thing when they see it .
In his third letter one can almost hear Hay 's chuckle in the certainty that his diplomatic , if somewhat wicked , suggestion would bear fruit .
Washington , D. C.July 7 , 1880 My dear Gunn : I have your letter , and the proposition which you make to pull a few proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive , and of course highly immoral .
I can not properly consent to it , and I am afraid the great many would think I was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence .
Very truly yours , John Hay .
`` If I made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601 rose I would say that Mark 's intellectual structure and subconscious graining was from Anglo-Saxons as primitive as the common man of the Tudor period .
Clemens , meanwhile , had sold out his interest in the Express , severed his connection with the Galaxy , a magazine for which he was doing a department each month , and had written a second book for the American Publishing Company , Roughing It , published in 1872 .
In August of the same year he made a trip to London , to get material for a book on England , but was too much sought after , too continuously feted , to do any work .
They sailed in April , 1873 , and spent a good portion of the year in England and Scotland .
SAINT LOUIS , March 9th , 1858 .
Ma was delighted with her trip , but she was disgusted with the girls for allowing me to embrace and kiss them -- and she was horrified at the Schottische as performed by Miss Castle and myself .
She was perfectly willing for me to dance until 12 o'clock at the imminent peril of my going to sleep on the after watch -- but then she would top off with a very inconsistent sermon on dancing in general ; ending with a terrific broadside aimed at that heresy of heresies , the Schottische .

When I came in the other evening , hungry and tired and ill-natured , and threw down my pick and shovel , Raish gave me your specimen -- said Bagley brought it , and asked me if it were cinnabar .
I examined it by the waning daylight , and took the specks of fine gold for sulphurets -- wrote you I did not think much of it -- and posted the letter immediately .
In the next letter and the one following it we get a hint of an episode , or rather of two incidents which he combined into an episode in Roughing It .
The other portions are irrelevant and of slight value .
The Quaker City was not to sail until the 8th of June , but the Alta wished some preliminary letters from New York .
He timed it for May 6th , which would be a few days after the appearance of Webb 's book .
We leave tonight , at two o'clock in the morning .
We send oceans and continents of love -- I have worked myself down , today .

To W. D. Howells , in Boston :
You read it to me , and it was mighty good ; I read it last night and it was better ; I read it aloud to the household this morning and it was better than ever .
Even if he knew it .
Good times to you all !
Mind if you do n't run here for a few days you will go to hence without having had a fore-glimpse of heaven .
She 's all right , now .
Day before yesterday was a fine summer day away up here on the summit .
This portion of Mr. Twichell 's sermon made a great impression upon me , and I was grieved that some one had not wakened me earlier so that I might have heard what went before .
Peace and plenty abide with you all !
-- and your sister .
MY DEAR HOWELLS , -- Since my return , the mail facilities have enabled Orion to keep me informed as to his intentions .
Afterward he began to sell off his furniture , with the idea of hurrying to Leadville and tackling silver-mining -- threw up his law den and took in his sign .
Then he wrote to Chicago and St. Louis newspapers asking for a situation as `` paragrapher '' -- enclosing a taste of his quality in the shape of two stanzas of `` humorous rhymes . ''
By a later mail on the same day he applied to New York and Hartford insurance companies for copying to do .
Getting pretty hungry to see you .
I had an idea that this was your shortest way home , but like as not my geography is crippled again -- it usually is .
I have a seat on the stage at Haverley 's Theatre , tonight , where the Army of the Tennessee will receive Gen. Grant , and where Gen. Sherman will make a speech .
Of course , any literary suggestion from `` Brother Sam '' was gospel to Orion , who began at once piling up manuscript at a great rate .
MY DEAR HOWELLS , -- There you stick , at Belmont , and now I 'm going to Washington for a few days ; and of course , between you and Providence that visit is going to get mixed , and you 'll have been here and gone again just about the time I get back .
To W. D. Howells , in Boston :
Sunday , Oct. 2 '80 .
I have spent three delightful days in Hannibal , loitering around all day long , examining the old localities and talking with the grey-heads who were boys and girls with me 30 or 40 years ago .
Spent an hour , yesterday , with A. W. Lamb , who was not married when I saw him last .
And now I have been talking with their grown-up sons and daughters .
He sold me $ 10,000 worth of another rose-tinted stock about the same time .
I have got that yet , also .
A financial scheme advertised in any religious paper is a thing which any living person ought to know enough to avoid ; and when the factor is added that M. runs that religious paper , a dead person ought to know enough to avoid it .
To think that thing might be possible to many ; but to be brave enough to say it is possible to you only , I certainly believe .
To have house and Bible shrink so , under the disillusioning corrected angle , is loss-for a moment .
I have n't got him in focus yet , but I 've got Browning ... .
We are in the full rush of the holidays now , and an awful rush it is , too .
You ought to have been here the other day , to make that day perfect and complete .
I made a party call the day after the party -- and called the lady down from breakfast to receive it .
The error here was , that the appointed reception-hour was 3 in the afternoon , and not at the bride 's house but at her aunt 's in another part of the town .
However , as I meant well , none of these disasters distressed me .
Lang had no admiration to express for the Yankee , which he confessed he had not cared to read , but he glorified Huck Finn to the highest .
But it was a losing investment , nor did it pay any better when Clemens finally sent Burbank with it on the road .
Good-day , and love to all of you .
Whoever buys will have a noble good opening -- a complete equipment , a well organized business , a capable and experienced manager , and enterprise not experimental but under full sail , and immediately able to pay 50 per cent a year on every dollar the publisher shall actually invest in it -- I mean in making and selling the books .
DEAR MR. HALL , -- ... ..
I hope the machine will be finished this month ; but it took me four years and cost me $ 100,000 to finish the other machine after it was apparently entirely complete and setting type like a house-afire .
It would get to the telegraph office toward 8 this morning and reach you at luncheon .
I tell you it was interesting !
The Chicago campaign , I mean .
On the way out Mr. Rogers would plan out the campaign while I walked the floor and smoked and assented .
Mrs. Fields said Aldrich begged to come and went away crying because she would n't let him .
She allowed only her family ( Sarah Orne Jewett and sister ) to be present , because much company would overtax Dr. Holmes .
Livy dear , when we got out to the house last night , Mrs. Rogers , who is up and around , now , did n't want to go down stairs to dinner , but Mr. R. persuaded her and we had a very good time indeed .
By 8 o'clock we were down again and bought a fifteen-dollar box in the Madison Square Garden ( Rogers bought it , not I , ) then he went and fetched Dr. Rice while I ( went ) to the Players and picked up two artists -- Reid and Simmons -- and thus we filled 5 of the 6 seats .
There was a vast multitude of people in the brilliant place .
`` What do you attribute this strange miracle to ? ''

We furnished them a bright day and comfortable weather -- and they used it all up , in their extravagant American way .
If we live another year , I hope we shall spend its summer in this house .
Up to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my suppressed `` Gospel . ''
But there we seem to separate .
Then why do n't we unwittingly reproduce the phrasing of a story , as well as the story itself ?
In 1866 I read Dr. Holmes 's poems , in the Sandwich Islands .
He was not an ignorant ass -- no , not he : he was not a collection of decayed human turnips , like your `` Plagiarism Court ; '' and so when I said , `` I know now where I stole it , but whom did you steal it from , '' he said , `` I do n't remember ; I only know I stole it from somebody , because I have never originated anything altogether myself , nor met anybody who had . ''
Has he heroes and heroines who are not cads and cadesses ?
No -- I assure you I am not .
Each person in it is honest in one or several ways , but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by -- by what ?
I had not read it before , since it was first published .
He had a passion for the game , but had played comparatively little since the old Hartford days of fifteen years before , when a group of his friends used to assemble on Friday nights in the room at the top of the house for long , strenuous games and much hilarity .
Your remark is not quite in accordance with the facts .
General Grant paid me compliments .
General Grant was a fair man , and recognized my worth ; but you are prejudiced , and you have hurt my feelings .
Wireless , not being as yet imprisoned in a Chinese wall of private cash and high-placed and formidable influence , will come to your aid and make your new campaign briefer and easier than the other one was .
Now , by his physician 's advice , he went back to those balmy islands .
Taking Claude , the butler , as his valet , he sailed January 5th , and presently sent back a letter in which he said , `` Again I am leading the ideal life , and am immeasurably content . ''
`` Yes , I could n't afford to bring them with me . ''
To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit nothing , the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose .
However when he had worn himself out and got quiet again , he looked the matter over and decided that the twins had some moral rights , although they had no legal ones ; they were of his blood , and it could not be decorous to treat them as common clay .
`` It will take a little time , Hawkins , but there 's no hurry , none in the world -- in the circumstances .
And of course certain duties have devolved upon me now , which necessarily claim my first attention .
This poor young nobleman -- ''
Ah , here was promotion !
He had struck the summit .
There were no higher heights to climb in that boarding house .
His popularity was complete .
We 'll draw them out on their art , if you like . ''
`` It accounts for it all -- all -- there 's something divine about his art , -- soulful , unsatisfactory , yearning , dim hearkening on the void horizon , vague -- murmuring to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances and far-sounding cataclysms of uncreated space -- oh , if he -- if , he -- has he ever tried distemper ?

The plaintive voice on a high fierce key , `` Scat , you devils '' -- and a racket as of flying missiles . )
It 's hideous . ''
`` All right , then .
I will begin on that at once .
`` I know it is , but we ca n't help our names . ''
We resolved not to `` lay by at Cottonwood . ''
That will give one an appreciable idea of those matchless roads .
Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold of the railing when the stage jolts , but when it only swings and sways , no grip is necessary .
There was no danger about it ; a sleeping man will seize the irons in time when the coach jolts .
These men were hard worked , and it was not possible for them to stay awake all the time .
Its foliage is a grayish green , and gives that tint to desert and mountain .
The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant , and grows right in the midst of deep sand , and among barren rocks , where nothing else in the vegetable world would try to grow , except `` bunch-grass . ''
-- [ `` Bunch-grass '' grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and neighboring territories , and offers excellent feed for stock , even in the dead of winter , wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it ; notwithstanding its unpromising home , bunch-grass is a better and more nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass that is known -- so stock-men say . ]
Jack , you ought to be ashamed of yourself -- you ought to be ashamed of such criminal ignorance .
Why , Moses , the great guide , soldier , poet , lawgiver of ancient Israel !
It was the very best green raw-hide , and capable of sustaining tons .
I made a slip-noose in the other end , and then hung it down to see the length .
I then loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge .
I said to myself , if he never thinks of that one thing that I dread , all right -- but if he does , all right anyhow -- I am fixed for him .
said I -- if my nerve fails now , I am lost .
`` Did you ever see the bull again ? ''
He went in the house .
In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and watching for the `` pony-rider '' -- the fleet messenger who sped across the continent from St. Joe to Sacramento , carrying letters nineteen hundred miles in eight days !
After awhile , seeing that Slade 's energetic administration had restored peace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road , the overland stage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the Rocky Mountains , to see if he could perform a like miracle there .
There was absolutely no semblance of law there .
The commonest misunderstandings were settled on the spot with the revolver or the knife .
It was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private reasons for it ; for other people to meddle would have been looked upon as indelicate .
After a murder , all that Rocky Mountain etiquette required of a spectator was , that he should help the gentleman bury his game -- otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him the first time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in interring him .
`` I was in dismay .
It was an astounding thing ; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty , that I was entirely nonplussed .
I am a business man -- have always been a business man -- do not know anything but business -- and so you can imagine how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country where written contracts were worthless !
-- that main security , that sheet-anchor , that absolute necessity , of business .
I talked with first one prominent citizen and then another .
He might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle , but something sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred refractory , half-civilized sub-contractors .
He had walked as long as he could , but his limbs had failed him at last .
Then we fed him a little , and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a grateful light softened his eye .
We made his mail-sack bed as comfortable as possible , and constructed a pillow for him with our coats .
He seemed very thankful .
Then he looked up in our faces , and said in a feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it :
She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of the Metropolitan Police of New York , and she would not desert him in his adversity as Governor of Nevada .
I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City westward to a certain point !
`` Suppose , now -- this is merely a supposition , you know -- suppose you could find a ledge that would yield , say , a hundred and fifty dollars a ton -- would that satisfy you ? ''
Before leaving Carson , the Secretary and I had purchased `` feet '' from various Esmeralda stragglers .
We had expected immediate returns of bullion , but were only afflicted with regular and constant `` assessments '' instead -- demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines .
Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and thence to Esmeralda .
I bought a horse and started , in company with Mr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff , a Prussian -- not the party who has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched foreign grammars , with their interminable repetitions of questions which never have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation among human beings .
We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days , and arrived at `` Honey Lake Smith 's , '' a sort of isolated inn on the Carson river .
It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds its melancholy way .
Close to the house were the Overland stage stables , built of sun-dried bricks .
There was not another building within several leagues of the place .
Wha -- what do you know 'bout Pennsylvania ? ''
An arched snow-drift broke up , now , and Ollendorff emerged from it , and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word .
`` Hold on a minute .
Another Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $ 16,000 a month ; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine that yielded it , for five dollars a day , when he first came to the country .
Just go in and toot your horn , if you do n't sell a clam .
But it didn't make no difference about that when it came down to what a man 's rights was -- and so , when some roughs jumped the Catholic bone-yard and started in to stake out town-lots in it he went for 'em !
And so would the banker .
He hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any individual I have ever met , of either sex ; and he was never tired of storming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be wary and drink with moderation .
He was a capacious container , but he did not hold enough for that .
-- He took another after he got the most of his clothes on , `` to settle his mind and give him his bearings . ''
-- And now , his state-room door swung open and the sun of his benignant face beamed redly out upon men and women and children , and he roared his `` Shipmets a'hoy ! ''
in a way that was calculated to wake the dead and precipitate the final resurrection ; and forth he strode , a picture to look at and a presence to enforce attention .
Hulumanu ( Military Company ) .
His Majesty 's Staff .
Carriage of Her Majesty the Queen Dowager .
H. B. M 's Acting Commissioner .
Marshal and Sheriffs of the different Islands .
The soldiers fired three volleys of musketry -- the wailing being previously silenced to permit of the guns being heard .
`` Then the priest , addressing himself to the King and chiefs , said : 'I will now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body .
To-morrow morning there will be a tabu , and , if the sacrifice be delayed until that time , forty men must die . '
The tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before I could gain any command over myself .
Just then , Philip Lynch , Publisher of the Gold Hill News , came in and said , blandly and cheerily , as if bringing good news :
THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND
`` There 's a footstep !
Good , I 've got it .
I 'm all right . ''
So I had to make another excuse .
I said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement ; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while , and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same , the darkness should be dismissed .
Why , it was like reading about France and the French , before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution , which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood -- one : a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell .
What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake ?
Then I told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies .
The procession moved with a good deal of promptness .
There were no casualties to report , for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen .
So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey , and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest ; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret , of twelve fair damsels , and two knights armed on great horses , and the damsels went to and fro by a tree .
Secondly , these missionaries would gradually , and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm , introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility , and from them it would work down to the people , if the priests could be kept quiet .
Next , education -- next , freedom -- and then she would begin to crumble .
It being my conviction that any Established Church is an established crime , an established slave-pen , I had no scruples , but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it .
Why , in my own former day -- in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time -- there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country : a `` free '' country with the Corporation Act and the Test still in force in it -- timbers propped against men's liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established Anachronism with .
It was new , and ought to have been rehearsed a little more .
`` The wrath and curse of God fall upon you , woman without pity , who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick , nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him ! ''
He sat upon a squared block of stone , with his head bent down , his forearms resting on his knees , his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face , and he was muttering to himself .
There were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present .
`` We want to take them to their home , do n't we ? ''
Just here was the wayside shop of a smith ; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back , deliverable here where her irons could be taken off .
They were removed ; then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith .
The moment the girl was delivered from her irons , she flung herself , all tears and frantic sobbings , into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped .
I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot 's solemn procession hove in sight -- which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence , because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted .
There was reputation in it .
That is all right , I thought -- peasants going to work ; nobody else likely to be stirring this early .
I was off like a shot , through the bushes , by the shortest cut .
For a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before I could get to him ; but desperation gives you wings , you know , and I canted my body forward , inflated my breast , and held my breath and flew .
And in plenty good enough time , too .
He was complete now with that knapsack on , and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen .
The drill went on , I prompting and correcting :
If he considered his knightly honor at stake here , that was the end of argument ; he would stay , and nothing could prevent it ; I was aware of that .
The man looked puzzled , and said :
`` You must allow me to have these friends come ; and you must also allow me to pay the costs . ''
`` Again ye 're conf -- ''
A voice called a halt from the other bank , and said :
We remained still , and awaited developments .
There was a wild outbreak of anger below , and the mob swarmed in from all around , and there we were treed , and prisoners .
The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the bridge .
But you get my idea ; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise I would wind up with at the palace .
It was all feasible , if I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a lock-pick .
However , my chance came at last .
A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me , without result , or indeed any approach to a result , came again .
It was a steel thing with a long pin to it , with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front .
A great shout went up , of welcome and admiration .
Tom went on groaning .
THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book , the more his ideas wandered .
Away off in the flaming sunshine , Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat , tinted with the purple of distance ; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air ; no other living thing was visible but some cows , and they were asleep .
His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer , though he did not know it .
He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk .
The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer , too , at this moment , but it was premature : for when he started thankfully to travel off , Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction .
`` What 's that ? ''
`` I bet it is . ''
`` I 'll try , but do n't you be afeard .
'Now I lay me down to sleep , I -- ' ''
Huck said , `` Y-e-s '' -- without any heart in it .
Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure , for it rained hard , there was no procession in consequence , and the greatest man in the world ( as Tom supposed ) , Mr. Benton , an actual United States Senator , proved an overwhelming disappointment -- for he was not twenty-five feet high , nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it .
`` I reckon maybe we 'll tackle the old tree that 's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow 's . ''
`` Well -- all right -- it wo n't matter to come here once more . ''
Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom .
The inmates were asleep , but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger , on account of the exciting episode of the night .
Describe them -- describe them , my boy ! ''
When I was a Sunday-school scholar something more than sixty years ago , I became interested in Satan , and wanted to find out all I could about him .
I asked Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who , being approached by a serpent , would not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber .
They are a blank .
Upon this Lord Penzance comments : `` It can not be doubted that Lord Campbell was right in this .
And after much argument and surmise which has been indulged in on this subject , we may , I think , safely put the notion on one side , for no less an authority than Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea of his having been clerk to an attorney has been `` blown to pieces . ''
It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me .
Then there will be no more quarrelling , no more bandying of disrespectful epithets , no more heart burnings .
You do n't remember me , but you were introduced to me in the arcade in Milan two years and a half ago by Lieutenant H . ''
`` I 've got an idea .
Suppos ' n we buckle down to it and give the Colonel a bit of a shove towards t'other end of the car ?
He would n't have so much influence , then , do n't you reckon ? ''
The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad 's breast .
They were all dressed alike , and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices { 1 } -- that is to say , each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer , which was not useful as a covering , it being of such scanty dimensions , neither was it ornamental ; from beneath it the hair fell , unparted , to the middle of the forehead , and was cropped straight around ; a clerical band at the neck ; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower ; full sleeves ; a broad red belt ; bright yellow stockings , gartered above the knees ; low shoes with large metal buckles .
It was a sufficiently ugly costume .
`` Oh , art HIS father , truly ?
Sweet heaven grant it be so -- then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me ! ''
Insult not mine ears with his hated name .
Am I to be baulked of my will ?
No , by the splendour of God !
Tom 's first royal dinner .
This remark sobered the father 's joviality , and brought his mind to business .
He turned angrily upon the Prince , and said --
In sooth , yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales ; to-day art thou my most gracious liege , Edward , King of England . ''
It does us all good to unbend sometimes .
This good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp ; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble peasant woman .
I was made an archangel on this very spot , it is five years ago , by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity .
Their presence filled this place with an intolerable brightness .
And they knelt to me , King !
yes , they knelt to me !
I have walked in the courts of heaven , and held speech with the patriarchs .
There -- now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob !
For I have walked in the golden courts ; I have seen the Deity face to face ! ''
-- I that might have been pope !
`` It grows sharper , '' he said ; `` yes , it grows sharper . ''
The hermit , grinding his teeth in impotent rage , moved swiftly out of the bedchamber , closing the door behind him ; and straightway the King heard a talk , to this effect , proceeding from the 'chapel ' : --
If such as you take an interest in such as he , know , then , that I have sent him of an errand .
`` Marry , there is but one -- Seymour , Earl of Hertford . ''
This was an historical pageant , representing the King 's immediate progenitors .
There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense white rose , whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her ; by her side was Henry VII.
, issuing out of a vast red rose , disposed in the same manner : the hands of the royal pair were locked together , and the wedding-ring ostentatiously displayed .
From the red and white roses proceeded a stem , which reached up to a second stage , occupied by Henry VIII.
One branch sprang from this pair , which mounted to a third stage , where sat the effigy of Edward VI .
himself , enthroned in royal majesty ; and the whole pageant was framed with wreaths of roses , red and white . '
His face lighted , and he confronted the ragged candidate with this question --
Yes , none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished Great Seal -- this forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well , but here his teachings must fail , for his teacher himself could not answer THAT question -- ah , very good , very good indeed ; now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in short order !
And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction , and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty confusion .

Still , it would have been well to make an exception in this one 's case , for he was a bitter man , and revengeful .
All through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in mind , and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating satisfaction for it .
`` Very well , madam , it is no matter .
I am a stranger ; he does not know me ; I am merely passing through the town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind .
My errand is now completed , and I go pleased and a little proud , and you will never see me again .
There is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything .
It began as follows : `` TO BE PUBLISHED , or , the right man sought out by private inquiry -- either will answer .
She listened awhile for burglars , then surrendered to curiosity , and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper : `` I am a foreigner , and am presently going back to my own country , to remain there permanently .
I am grateful to America for what I have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag ; and to one of her citizens -- a citizen of Hadleyburg -- I am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago .
I was a gambler .
I say I WAS .
I arrived in this village at night , hungry and without a penny .
He gave me twenty dollars -- that is to say , he gave me life , as I considered it .
Now I have no idea who that man was , but I want him found , and I want him to have this money , to give away , throw away , or keep , as he pleases .
If I could stay , I would find him myself ; but no matter , he will be found .
This man can be identified by the remark which he made to me ; I feel persuaded that he will remember it .
`` And now my plan is this : If you prefer to conduct the inquiry privately , do so .
Mr. Burgess ( if he will be kind enough to act ) ; and let Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack , open it , and see if the remark is correct : if correct , let the money be delivered , with my sincere gratitude , to my benefactor thus identified . ''
Mrs. Richards sat down , gently quivering with excitement , and was soon lost in thinkings -- after this pattern : `` What a strange thing it is !
... And what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the waters !
If it had only been my husband that did it !
Then , with a shudder -- '' But it is GAMBLERS ' money !
Always at the grind , grind , grind , on a salary -- another man's slave , and he sitting at home in his slippers , rich and comfortable . ''
`` I am so sorry for you , Edward , you know that ; but be comforted ; we have our livelihood ; we have our good name -- '' `` Yes , Mary , and that is everything .
Kiss me -- there , it 's all gone now , and I am not complaining any more .
Give me the paper . ''
He skimmed through it and said : `` Is n't it an adventure !
Why , it 's a romance ; it 's like the impossible things one reads about in books , and never sees in life . ''
And it will make all the other towns jealous ; for no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but Hadleyburg , and they know it .
`` But after all , Mary , it must be for the best -- it must be ; we know that .
And we must remember that it was so ordered -- ''
He devoured it , his brain reeling .
`` With great pleasure .
He stood looking vacantly at first one of the men and then the other , and did not seem to know what to do .

Then the shoutings at the Chair began again , all over the place :
I can live on a pretty low diet , but I ca n't get along on no sustenance at all .
'Yes , indeed ; I should die if I could n't have it -- especially here .
-- oh , the bitterness of that search !
There was deep silence while one might count his fingers ten or twelve times , then my heart began to sink , and around me the mockings began again , and grew steadily louder and more assured , until at last , when I gave up , they burst into volley after volley of cruel laughter .
'The chief of the court asked :
She wants you to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain . '
'A little book , merely a little book -- could words be modester ?
Is it because he has captured the takingest name ?
the great Francois Millet ? '
Answer me that . ''
Everybody broke out into a rousing hurrah of applause ; and all jumped up and capered about the room and fell on each other 's necks in transports of gratitude and joy .
The ship sank suddenly at about 5 A.M. We find the sun very hot and scorching , but all try to keep out of it as much as we can .
They are still anxiously watching for a sail , but they have only 'visions of ships that come to naught -- the shadow without the substance . '
The second mate catches a booby this afternoon , a bird which consists mainly of feathers ; 'but as they have no other meat , it will go well . '
It is Exhibit A in the Church 's assets , and we pull it out every Sunday and give it an airing .
It is strictly religious furniture , like an acolyte , or a contribution-plate , or any of those things .
I think , myself , that it is only a toy ; but Szczepanik claims more for it , and I know him well enough to believe that he can see father than I can -- either with his telelectroscope or without it . '
'But Szczepanik is still alive . '
'There -- now you have touched upon a crying defect in the complaint system .
'I have nothing of the kind , but I have my orders , and that is sufficient .
They must be obeyed . '
The waiter brought the steward , who explained in a low and polite voice that the thing was impossible -- it was against the rule , and the rule was rigid .
But she is in society now ; and papa has to stand it .
She ought to realise , now that she has 'come out , ' that this is a right and proper time to change a part of her style .
P. 'I call Representative Wolf to order !
Behold , then , the individual who guards the box , who puts his forty dollars upon those of Smiley , and who attends ( et qui attendre ) .
And figure you that he takes Daniel , him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him fills with shot of the hunt , even him fills just to the chin , then he him puts by the earth .
Smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp .
'Then you supposition is at fault . '
He was a stranger in the country ; that was all we ever found out about him .
It seemed to me that I was not rightly equipped for this awful business ; that war was intended for men , and I for a child 's nurse .
Never heard anything like it ; tongue journalled on ball-bearings !
I wonder what she said ; seemed to be swearing , mainly .
Auf English , change cars -- oder subject .
`` To rob the others . ''
Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon , but I did n't ; I was n't ever so wide awake in my life .
It took me a long time , and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong , but at last I struck it .
It was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your little finger , and I says to myself there 's a di'mond in the nest you 've come from .
`` Yes , and the very colors in them loud countrified Sunday clothes -- plaid breeches , green and black -- ''
We was out and gone the minute the rain stopped .
It was just broad day then .
Tom was all afire and 'most out of breath when we come tearing in where Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally and Benny was .
We went up every day to see the old people , but it was awful dreary , because the old man war n't sleeping much , and was walking in his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable , and his mind got shaky , and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him .
And whenever we tried to persuade him to feel cheerfuler , he only shook his head and said if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderer 's load in your heart we would n't talk that way .
It made things seem fifty times as dreadful , and there war n't no more comfort for Aunt Sally and Benny .
`` You will add no signature .
He must receive this before he learns of the reward-placard -- before he rises in the morning -- lest he lose his head and fly the place penniless . ''
The village is a couple of miles long ; the cabins stand well apart from each other .
They drink there , and play seven-up and dominoes ; also billiards , for there is a table , crossed all over with torn places repaired with court-plaster ; there are some cues , but no leathers ; some chipped balls which clatter when they run , and do not slow up gradually , but stop suddenly and sit down ; there is part of a cube of chalk , with a projecting jag of flint in it ; and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar 's expense .
`` Come , everybody , and look at this !
`` Right you are , Wells-Fargo .
And look at that frown -- that 's deep thinking -- away down , down , forty fathom into the bowels of things .
`` 'Yarn , perhaps ?
`` You bet you !
`` Boys , I ai n't sorry , now , that he was n't here to roust out the child ; this is a bigger thing , by a long sight .
Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger , carrying an old hand-bag , limped by with his head down , and I caught the scent I had chased around the globe !
I had heard a good deal about the sheriff , but for reassurance 's sake I asked ,
One could not promenade without risking his neck ; at one moment the bowsprit was taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven , and at the next it was trying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean .
`` What 's a swindle ? ''
If you have got your hand in for inventing authors and testimony , I have nothing more to say -- let them be on the same side . ''
Finally Dan said musingly :
And here are aged Moors with flowing white beards and long white robes with vast cowls ; and Bedouins with long , cowled , striped cloaks ; and Negroes and Riffians with heads clean-shaven except a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or , rather , upon the after corner of the skull ; and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weird costumes , and all more or less ragged .
And here are Moorish women who are enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes , and whose sex can only be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and never look at men of their own race , or are looked at by them in public .
Here are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines , sashes about their waists , slippers upon their feet , little skullcaps upon the backs of their heads , hair combed down on the forehead , and cut straight across the middle of it from side to side -- the selfsame fashion their Tangier ancestors have worn for I do n't know how many bewildering centuries .
Their feet and ankles are bare .
Spain is the only nation the Moors fear .
We tried to map out excursions for the morrow ; we puzzled over French `` guides to Paris '' ; we talked disjointedly in a vain endeavor to make head or tail of the wild chaos of the day 's sights and experiences ; we subsided to indolent smoking ; we gaped and yawned and stretched -- then feebly wondered if we were really and truly in renowned Paris , and drifted drowsily away into that vast mysterious void which men call sleep .
`` Alphonse Henri Gustave de Hauteville , '' I suggested .
Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it .
When we arrived at the garden in Asnieres , we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it , and grass plots , and long , curving rows of ornamental shrubbery , with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in .
We moved along the sinuous gravel walks , with the great concourse of girls and young men , and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple , starred over and over and over again with brilliant gas jets , burst upon us like a fallen sun .
The tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my ignorance !
The Frenchman was checkmated .
This was all Greek to him .
The natives play only a sort of pool on them .
We have never seen any body playing the French three-ball game yet , and I doubt if there is any such game known in France , or that there lives any man mad enough to try to play it on one of these European tables .
It was what I thought when I stood before `` The Last Supper '' and heard men apostrophizing wonders , and beauties and perfections which had faded out of the picture and gone , a hundred years before they were born .
We can imagine the beauty that was once in an aged face ; we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps ; but we can not absolutely see these things when they are not there .
I am willing to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon the Last Supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left , supply a tint that has faded away , restore an expression that is gone ; patch , and color , and add , to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall stand before him aglow with the life , the feeling , the freshness , yea , with all the noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand of the master .
But I can not work this miracle .
Can those other uninspired visitors do it , or do they only happily imagine they do ?
Tahoe for a sea in the clouds : a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at times , at times in savage storms ; a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded by a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand feet above the level world ; a sea whose every aspect is impressive , whose belongings are all beautiful , whose lonely majesty types the Deity !

`` His tongue and his heart , which were found after nearly a century to be whole , when the body was disinterred before his canonization , are still preserved in a glass case , and after two centuries the heart is still whole .
When the French troops came to Rome , and when Pius VII .
The palace is modeled after the choicest forms of Grecian architecture , and its wide colonnades surround a central court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their fragrance , and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer air , and may possibly breed mosquitoes , but I do not think it does .
I was dressed within the ten minutes , and came out .
The saloon tent had been stripped of its sides , and had nothing left but its roof ; so when we sat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain , sea and hazy valley .
And sitting thus , the sun rose slowly up and suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring .
We can see the long , whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the eastern hills .
But this last new horse I have got is trying to break his neck over the tent-ropes , and I shall have to go out and anchor him .
Jericho and I have parted company .
One of his hind legs bends the wrong way , and the other one is as straight and stiff as a tent-pole .
His nose has been broken at some time or other , and is arched like a culvert now .
His under lip hangs down like a camel 's , and his ears are chopped off close to his head .
I had some trouble at first to find a name for him , but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec , because he is such a magnificent ruin .
Travelers are expected to pay for seeing them , and they do it cheerfully .
We like the idea .
Our pilgrims ' chief sin is their lust for `` specimens . ''
Of this there is never but one at a time , and that lives five hundred years .
They would n't care .
Mutton-chops and sin is good enough living for them .
If any Bedouins had approached us , then , from that point of the compass , they would have paid dearly for their rashness .
There would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there that no pen could describe .
Another was going to scalp such Bedouins as fell to his share , and take his bald-headed sons of the desert home with him alive for trophies .
But the wild-eyed pilgrim rhapsodist was silent .
If he had got a Bedouin , what would he have done with him -- shot him ?
horror what would he have done ?
Storm blew two land birds to sea , and they came on board .
He was so tired , though , that he had to light , at last , or perish .
He stopped in the foretop , repeatedly , and was as often blown away by the wind .
They rise in flocks of three hundred and flash along above the tops of the waves a distance of two or three hundred feet , then fall and disappear .
Well , perhaps , it was a pleasure excursion , but certainly it did not look like one ; certainly it did not act like one .
Any body 's and every body 's notion of a well conducted funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse , and chief mourners and mourners by courtesy , many old people , much solemnity , no levity , and a prayer and a sermon withal .
There was a picnic crowd for you !
It was chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years .
Is any man insane enough to imagine that this picnic of patriarchs sang , made love , danced , laughed , told anecdotes , dealt in ungodly levity ?
In my experience they sinned little in these matters .
The venerable excursionists were not gay and frisky .
They played no blind-man 's buff ; they dealt not in whist ; they shirked not the irksome journal , for alas !
He said , `` _That_ will not happen in _any case_ , it does n't make any difference which way I go around this flower-bed . ''
I performed alone , every night , the rest of the fortnight .
There is nothing surprising about this .
, he was learned , white-haired and venerable , nobly and richly clad in the fashions of an earlier and a courtlier day , he was large and stately , and he not only seemed wise , but was what he seemed , in that regard .
He had great influence , and his opinion upon any matter was worth much more than that of any other person in the community .
He borrowed the cash at ten per cent .
interest , from an old farmer named Johnson who lived five miles out of town .
Then he reduced the subscription price of the paper from two dollars to one dollar .
It cost him nothing in my case , for he never was able to pay me a penny as long as I was with him .
He could not afford to pay rent of any kind , so he moved the whole plant into the house we lived in , and it cramped the dwelling-place cruelly .
The paper was a dead failure .
The farmhouse stood in the middle of a very large yard , and the yard was fenced on three sides with rails and on the rear side with high palings ; against these stood the smokehouse ; beyond the palings was the orchard ; beyond the orchard were the negro quarter and the tobacco-fields .
The front yard was entered over a stile , made of sawed-off logs of graduated heights ; I do not remember any gate .
In a corner of the front yard were a dozen lofty hickory-trees and a dozen black-walnuts , and in the nutting season riches were to be gathered there .
`` Yes , the whole time . ''
It reminds me of the man who was reproached by a friend , who said ,
It nearly took my breath away ; though I thought I might possibly have misunderstood .
`` I have come to tell you something , mother , which will distress you , but you must be good and brave , and bear it .

I said to the miner , `` Why , my dear sir , _these_ were not the gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage ; these were impostors . ''
In September he wrote the poem to the baby , already quoted from .
In the first week of October Shelley and family went to Warwick , then to Edinburgh , arriving there about the middle of the month .
Then that house was complete , and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol , whose testimony is infallible .
Swinging signs creaked in the wind the street 's whole length .
Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so .
Those belonging to the little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped ; the big Orleans liners stopped for hails only , or to land passengers or freight ; and this was the case also with the great flotilla of `` transients . ''
These latter came out of a dozen rivers -- the Illinois , the Missouri , the Upper Mississippi , the Ohio , the Monongahela , the Tennessee , the Red River , the White River , and so on -- and were bound every whither and stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity , which the Mississippi 's communities could want , from the frosty Falls of St. Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans .
The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll , about forty years old , judge of the county court .
He was fine and just and generous .
To be a gentleman -- a gentleman without stain or blemish -- was his only religion , and to it he was always faithful .
He and his wife were very nearly happy , but not quite , for they had no children .
The women were good and commonplace people , and did their duty , and had their reward in clear consciences and the community 's approbation .
Pembroke Howard , lawyer and bachelor , aged almost forty , was another old Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families .
He was a fine , majestic creature , a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the Virginia rule , a devoted Presbyterian , an authority on the `` code '' , and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you , and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from bradawls to artillery .
He was a prosperous man , with a good head for speculations , and his fortune was growing .
Roxy remained in charge of the children .
She had her own way , for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices .
This was Mr. David Wilson , a young fellow of Scotch parentage .
He was twenty-five years old , college bred , and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern law school a couple of years before .
He was a homely , freckled , sandy-haired young fellow , with an intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort .
The group searched his face with curiosity , with anxiety even , but found no light there , no expression that they could read .
They fell away from him as from something uncanny , and went into privacy to discuss him .
`` Said he wished he owned _half_ of the dog , the idiot , '' said a third .
The next day -- that is to say , on the fourth of September -- something occurred which profoundly impressed Roxana .
In truth , it had happened three times before .
Driscoll 's patience was exhausted .
Necessarily the thief must be one of his Negros .
They were not related .
Tom always made Chambers go in swimming with him , and stay by him as a protection .
Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate , and had died without succeeding .
He was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his envied young devil of an heir a pauper .
Do n't go to uncle .
She rose , and gloomed above him like a Fate .
`` Count Luigi is a confessed assassin . ''
When Roxana arrived , she found her son in such despair and misery that her heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her .
He was ruined past hope now ; his destruction would be immediate and sure , and he would be an outcast and friendless .
Tom scored his accounts , and resolved to keep to the very letter of his reform , and never to put that will in jeopardy again .
According to his mother 's plan , he was to put that safely away , and add her half of his pension to it monthly .
Roxana began to cry softly , and presently words began to find their way out between her sobs .
They were uttered lamentingly , rather than angrily .
Roxana darted a suspicious glance at him .
In the heyday of the steamboating prosperity , the river from end to end was flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts , all managed by hand , and employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to describe .
And that flatboatman would be sure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat , swearing stoutly that he had a light burning all the time , when in truth his gang had the lantern down below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by , and no watch on deck .
Once , at night , in one of those forest-bordered crevices ( behind an island ) which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase 'as dark as the inside of a cow , ' we should have eaten up a Posey County family , fruit , furniture , and all , but that they happened to be fiddling down below , and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off , doing no serious damage , unfortunately , but coming so near it that we had good hopes for a moment .
Some of these chutes were utter solitudes .
The swinging grape-vines , the grassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by , the flowering creepers waving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks , and all the spendthrift richness of the forest foliage , were wasted and thrown away there .
The chutes were lovely places to steer in ; they were deep , except at the head ; the current was gentle ; under the 'points ' the water was absolutely dead , and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender willow thickets projected you could bury your boat 's broadside in them as you tore along , and then you seemed fairly to fly .
But still the cries held out , and drew nearer , and presently the voice said pluckily --
Instantly Mr. Brown would break in --
To do this , it would be necessary to go from place to place by the short packet lines .
Cairo was still there -- easily visible across the long , flat point upon whose further verge it stands ; but we had to steam a long way around to get to it .
This keeps down hard feelings .
You are never entirely in the dark , now ; there is always a beacon in sight , either before you , or behind you , or abreast .
By this means all was discovered ; for Stewart turned traitor , although he had taken the oath , and having obtained every information , exposed the whole concern , the names of all the parties , and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient evidence against Murel , to procure his conviction and sentence to the Penitentiary ( Murel was sentenced to fourteen years ' imprisonment ) ; so many people who were supposed to be honest , and bore a respectable name in the different States , were found to be among the list of the Grand Council as published by Stewart , that every attempt was made to throw discredit upon his assertions -- his character was vilified , and more than one attempt was made to assassinate him .
It is , however , now well ascertained to have been all true ; and although some blame Mr. Stewart for having violated his oath , they no longer attempt to deny that his revelations were correct .
I will quote one or two portions of Murel 's confessions to Mr. Stewart , made to him when they were journeying together .
I ought to have observed , that the ultimate intentions of Murel and his associates were , by his own account , on a very extended scale ; having no less an object in view than RAISING THE BLACKS AGAINST THE WHITES , TAKING POSSESSION OF , AND PLUNDERING NEW ORLEANS , AND MAKING THEMSELVES POSSESSORS OF THE TERRITORY .
He had been to Tennessee to buy a drove of hogs , but when he got there pork was dearer than he calculated , and he declined purchasing .
Crenshaw winked at me ; I understood his idea .
'Fifteen hundred devils ! '
This man had kept a diary during -- six weeks ?
The first day , eight close pages ; the second , five ; the third , one -- loosely written ; the fourth , three or four lines ; a line or two the fifth and sixth days ; seventh day , diary abandoned ; life in terrific Vicksburg having now become commonplace and matter of course .

And here is the aggravated form -- heard a ragged street Arab say it to a comrade : 'I was a-ask'n ' Tom whah you was a-sett'n' at . '
The Northern word 'guess ' -- imported from England , where it used to be common , and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as a Yankee original -- is but little used among Southerners .
They have n't any 'does n't ' in their language ; they say 'do n't ' instead .
'At 4 o'clock ominous clouds began to gather in the south-east , and presently from the Gulf there came a blow which increased in severity every moment .
It was not safe to leave the landing then , and there was a delay .
The oaks shook off long tresses of their mossy beards to the tugging of the wind , and the bayou in its ambition put on miniature waves in mocking of much larger bodies of water .

Such are the actual facts ; and not all novels have for a base so telling a situation .
But while I was shamefully trying to draw attention to these poor chaps -- who were doubtless directing the celestial attention to me at the same moment , though I never once suspected that -- I had heedlessly left my candle burning .
He had always used that same consecrated knife ; with it he had murdered his long array of Lynches , and with it he had left upon the forehead of each victim a peculiar mark -- a cross , deeply incised .
Bear Creek -- so called , perhaps , because it was always so particularly bare of bears -- is hidden out of sight now , under islands and continents of piled lumber , and nobody but an expert can find it .
I used to get drowned in it every summer regularly , and be drained out , and inflated and set going again by some chance enemy ; but not enough of it is unoccupied now to drown a person in .
In a little time his breast was affected .
She was afraid , but he told her to muster courage .

He obeyed , and stood ready to give the blow ; while the leader , who steered , directed the canoe for the open mouth of the monster .

This good old custom prevailed in this ship , and under unusually favorable circumstances , for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing like a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it in ; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in , too -- and in flooding abundance .
But that was a mistake .

Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels , the naturalist said that the coniferous and bacteriological output of Australasia was remarkable for its many and curious departures from the accepted laws governing these species of tubercles , but that in his opinion Nature's fondness for dabbling in the erratic was most notably exhibited in that curious combination of bird , fish , amphibian , burrower , crawler , quadruped , and Christian called the Ornithorhynchus -- grotesquest of animals , king of the animalculae of the world for versatility of character and make-up .

Such immigrants as could be induced to cross the seas thus found themselves in possession of thousands of coffee , cocoa , banana , and bread-fruit trees , the raising of which had cost the wretched natives years of toil whilst the latter had a few five-franc pieces to spend in the liquor stores of Noumea . ''
Then they went down into the earth with deep shafts , seeking the gravelly beds of ancient rivers and brooks -- and found them .
The next biggest of the two monster nuggets mentioned above came from an old river-channel 180 feet under ground .
Several were disabled for life .
No wonder that but one party , escaping from Macquarrie Harbor convict settlement , arrived at the civilized region in safety .
They were boiling over with youth and spirits , and they had to make the intervals of idleness endurable in some way ; and as a rule , they did it by contriving practical jokes and playing them upon each other .
If it re-grows the prongs , the parasite returns and the same thing is repeated .
The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy to commit murder , but they were morally guilty of it .

For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their property ;
She has built fortresses of such magnitude that the show-strongholds of the rest of the world are but modest little things by comparison ; palaces that are wonders for rarity of materials , delicacy and beauty of workmanship , and for cost ; and one tomb which men go around the globe to see .
It takes eighty nations , speaking eighty languages , to people her , and they number three hundred millions .
In my sleep they remained with me , and tried to strangle me .
It was he that brought me the invitation from his master to go to Baroda and lecture to that prince -- and now he was misbehaving in my dreams .
The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awful sacrilege , and even the Thugs recognized this ; yet now and then the lust for blood was too strong , and so they did kill a few cow-keepers .
He said , 'Very well , take me with you . '
So we took him with us to Selempore , where we slept that night .
Madara was ready behind him , and strangled him .
He never spoke a word .
He was about 60 or 70 years of age . ''
`` Strangled him and threw him in a well ! ''
In one case they threw sixteen into a well -- and they had thrown others in the same well before .
It makes a body thirsty to read about it .
Tall , slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out of it and give it picturesqueness , viewed from the river .
The city is as busy as an ant-hill , and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the web of narrow streets reminds one of the ants .
As we took our leave of the Benares god and started away we noticed a group of natives waiting respectfully just within the gate -- a Rajah from somewhere in India , and some people of lesser consequence .
The god beckoned them to come , and as we passed out the Rajah was kneeling and reverently kissing his sacred feet .
It was not a pleasure excursion in name only , but in fact .
These returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results ; the sort of uniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in the world's capitals , and the proportions of deaths by this , that , and the other disease .
Then came the outbreak at Meerut , then the capture of Delhi by the mutineers ; in June came the three-weeks leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler in his open lot at Cawnpore -- 40 miles distant from Lucknow -- then the treacherous massacre of that gallant little garrison ; and now the great revolt was in full flower , and the comfortable condition of things at Lucknow was instantly changed .

His eye had fallen upon something in the newspaper .
Jameson was intercepted by the Boers on New Year 's Day , and on the next day he surrendered .
I have seen active service in the field , and it was in the actualities of war that I acquired my training and my right to speak .
General Grant knew the history of my campaign , for I told it him .
General Grant was not given to paying compliments , yet he said frankly that if I had conducted the whole war much bloodshed would have been spared , and that what the army might have lost through the inspiriting results of collision in the field would have been amply made up by the liberalizing influences of travel .
Further endorsement does not seem to me to be necessary .
I have traveled more than anyone else , and I have noticed that even the angels speak English with an accent .
A pang shot through me as I said to myself , `` Poor fellow , poor fellow !
Well , it was only a suggestion ; nothing more .
How did you happen to meet Burr ?

I know the region where the Seventh 's child 's aunt lives ; I know all the lovely country for miles around ; I 'll bet I 've seen her aunt 's villa many a time ; I'll bet I 've been in it in those pleasant old times when I was a Spanish gentleman . ''

The two methods I have already touched upon are very simple , and are only used in the raising of the commonest class of fowls ; one is for summer , the other for winter .

But it being night , how is it that we could see him ? ''
It is a phenomenon of inconceivable importance and interest , view it as one may , but its interest to us is vastly heightened by an added knowledge of its nature which no scholar has heretofore possessed or even suspected .
I heard his stately tramp die away , step by step down the stairs and out into the deserted street , and felt sorry that he was gone , poor fellow -- and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my bath-tub .
`` Brought the boots himself !

It does them good .
Then the Secretary of the Navy asked me who I was ; and when I told him I was connected with the government , he wanted to know in what capacity .
I said that , without remarking upon the singularity of such a question , coming , as it did , from a member of that same government , I would inform him that I was clerk of the Senate Committee on Conchology .
He finished by ordering me to leave the premises , and give my attention strictly to my own business in future .
The Secretary of the Treasury , pursuing me to the last , drew his pen through all the other items , and simply marked in the margin `` Not allowed . ''
So , the dread alternative is embraced at last .
No member , young or old , of a branch Christian-Scientist church can acquire and retain membership in the Mother-Church unless he pay `` capitation tax '' ( of `` not less than a dollar , '' say the By-Laws ) to the Boston Trust every year .
These features of him were , indeed , extraordinary , but the rest of him was ordinary and usual .
He was so mean-minded , in the matter of jealousy , that it was thought he was descended from a god ; he was vain in little ways , and had a pride in trivialities ; he doted on ballads about moonshine and bruised hearts ; in education he was deficient , he was indifferent to literature , and knew nothing of art ; he was dumb upon all subjects but one , indifferent to all except that one -- the Nebular Theory .
The official astronomers disputed his facts and deeded his views , and said that he had invented both , they not being findable in any of the books .
But many of the laity , who wanted their nebulosities fresh , admired his doctrine and adopted it , and it attained to great prosperity in spite of the hostility of the experts . ''

Let some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can imagine her furnishing that consent .
It was the power which proceeded from her people 's recognition of her as a supernatural personage , conveyer of the Latest Word , and divinely commissioned to deliver it to the world .
The form which such a recognition takes , consciously or unconsciously , is worship ; and worship does not question nor criticize , it obeys .
Any Christian who was in earnest and not a make-believe , not a policy -- Christian , not a Christian for revenue only , had that healing power , and could cure with it any disease or any hurt or damage possible to human flesh and bone .
Without them the Branch Church is as dead as if its throat had been cut .
To have control , then , of the Readers , is to have control of the Branch Churches .
Many of the subjects of the other monarchs feel their yoke , and are restive under it ; their loyalty is insincere .

The twins were wet and tired , and they proceeded to undress without any preliminary remarks .
The abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat hard to get off , for it was like skinning a tarantula ; but it came at last , after much tugging and perspiring .
Each cravat , as to color , was in perfect taste , so far as its owner 's complexion was concerned -- a delicate pink , in the case of the blond brother , a violent scarlet in the case of the brunette -- but as a combination they broke all the laws of taste known to civilization .
Nothing more fiendish and irreconcilable than those shrieking and blaspheming colors could have been contrived .

She was sixteen now , shapely and graceful , and of a beauty so extraordinary that I might allow myself any extravagance of language in describing it and yet have no fear of going beyond the truth .
There was in her face a sweetness and serenity and purity that justly reflected her spiritual nature .

When we were half-way to Chinon we happened upon yet one more squad of enemies .

`` She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a-floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck .
`` No ; is dat so ? ''
Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s'pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
I could n't answer that .
So I reckoned I would n't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time .

WELL , when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for Uncle William , and she 'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it .
The king said the cubby would do for his valley -- meaning me .
I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size .
But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind .
You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand .
It sounds like flattery , but it ain't no flattery .
And when it comes to beauty -- and goodness , too -- she lays over them all .
But by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was sold -- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
So they 'd got to work that off -- I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING .

Mortification set in , and they had to amputate him .

It was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says :
`` To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ? ''

`` Oh , for the land 's sake !

`` I know , but -- ''
We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it .
Well , they was handsome and striped , and there war n't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she could n't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it did n't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out .
I never see such a woman .
And you could hear her whoop to Jericho .
And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire .
She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there had n't ever been no snakes created .
It was very curious .
They was setting around , some of them talking a little , in a low voice , and all of them fidgety and uneasy , but trying to look like they war n't ; but I knowed they was , because they was always taking off their hats , and putting them on , and scratching their heads , and changing their seats , and fumbling with their buttons .
I war n't easy myself , but I did n't take my hat off , all the same .
She flung herself at Tom , crying , and says :
And we had him up to the sick-room , and had a high talk ; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient , and doing it up so good , and Jim was pleased most to death , and busted out , and says :
He did nothing of the kind .
He COULD NOT ORIGINATE THE IDEA -- it had to come to him from the OUTSIDE .
Perhaps his sweetheart turned up her nose and said , `` I am told that you are a coward ! ''

So I started for the Amazon without reflecting and without asking any questions .

They withdrew from society , and grew more and more mysterious and dreadful .
They presently achieved the distinction of being denounced by names from the pulpit -- which made an immense stir !
This was grandeur , this was fame .
It was a secret name , and was divulged to no outsider ; publicly they were simply the abolitionists .
Yes , there were great missionaries in those days , for the methods were sure and the rewards great .
We have no such missionaries now , and no such methods .
At four-thirty the nose had changed its shape considerably , and the altered slant of the sun had revealed and made conspicuous a huge buttress or barrier of naked rock which was so located as to answer very well for a shoulder or coat-collar to this swarthy and indiscreet sweetheart who had stolen out there right before everybody to pillow his head on the Virgin 's white breast and whisper soft sentimentalities to her in the sensuous music of the crashing ice-domes and the boom and thunder of the passing avalanche -- music very familiar to his ear , for he has heard it every afternoon at this hour since the day he first came courting this child of the earth , who lives in the sky , and that day is far , yes -- for he was at this pleasant sport before the Middle Ages drifted by him in the valley ; before the Romans marched past , and before the antique and recordless barbarians fished and hunted here and wondered who he might be , and were probably afraid of him ; and before primeval man himself , just emerged from his four-footed estate , stepped out upon this plain , first sample of his race , a thousand centuries ago , and cast a glad eye up there , judging he had found a brother human being and consequently something to kill ; and before the big saurians wallowed here , still some eons earlier .
Oh yes , a day so far back that the eternal son was present to see that first visit ; a day so far back that neither tradition nor history was born yet and a whole weary eternity must come and go before the restless little creature , of whose face this stupendous Shadow Face was the prophecy , would arrive in the earth and begin his shabby career and think it a big thing .
Oh , indeed yes ; when you talk about your poor Roman and Egyptian day-before-yesterday antiquities , you should choose a time when the hoary Shadow Face of the Jungfrau is not by .
It antedates all antiquities known or imaginable ; for it was here the world itself created the theater of future antiquities .
The little children of Bayreuth could do that with a finer sympathy and a broader intelligence than I. I only care to bring four or five pilgrims to the operas , pilgrims able to appreciate them and enjoy them .
The funereal rustling of dresses and the low buzz of conversation began to die swiftly down , and presently not the ghost of a sound was left .
A verb is something to eat .
`` Caterpillar '' is well enough , but capital letter would have been stricter .

The mother lay languidly looking , musing , waiting ; suddenly she turned white and gasped out :
Still , it is now necessary to begin to pull , and to keep it up ; for lack of space requires us to synopsize .
But never mind about that , it is no matter .
Nasby and I saw the machine through a window , and went in to look at it .
The salesman explained it to us , showed us samples of its work , and said it could do fifty-seven words a minute -- a statement which we frankly confessed that we did not believe .
He tilted his eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy .
I have a teacher now , and my enthusiasm continually and tumultuously grows , as I learn to use with more and more facility the pencil , brush , and graver .

When he was sent to the kitchen for anything , he marched upright till he got to the door ; he turned hand-springs the rest of the way .
They say that the Bermuda climate is mild and equable , with never any snow or ice , and that one may be very comfortable in spring clothing the year round , there .
We had delightful and decided summer weather in May , with a flaming sun that permitted the thinnest of raiment , and yet there was a constant breeze ; consequently we were never discomforted by heat .
The nights are said to be always cool and bracing .
In the morning we were all a-tiptoe to witness the intricate ceremony of inspecting the ship .
One thinks Heidelberg by day -- with its surroundings -- is the last possibility of the beautiful ; but when he sees Heidelberg by night , a fallen Milky Way , with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border , he requires time to consider upon the verdict .

When we got downtown I found that we could go by rail to within five miles of Heilbronn .
I got to talking some pretty private matters presently , and Harris became nervous ; so he nudged me and said :
With the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance , the von Berlichingen of that day shut his daughter up in his donjon keep , or his oubliette , or his culverin , or some such place , and resolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from among her rich and noble lovers .
I do not know what it signifies .
It is said that the Dilsbergers do not emigrate much ; they find that living up there above the world , in their peaceful nest , is pleasanter than living down in the troublous world .
The seven hundred inhabitants are all blood-kin to each other , too ; they have always been blood-kin to each other for fifteen hundred years ; they are simply one large family , and they like the home folks better than they like strangers , hence they persistently stay at home .
But the finest thing within the ruin 's limits was a noble linden , which the children said was four hundred years old , and no doubt it was .
It had a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage .
An egg which I had kept back from breakfast that morning , was broken in packing .
I had shown it to the best connoisseurs in Heidelberg , and they all said it was an antique .
We had a pleasant trip to it , for the Rhine valley is always lovely .
If I remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours , therefore I judge that the distance was very little , if any , over fifty miles .
We quitted the train at Oos , and walked the entire remaining distance to Baden-Baden , with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon , the weather being exhaustingly warm .
Baden-Baden sits in the lap of the hills , and the natural and artificial beauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly .
Thrice a day a fine band makes music in the public promenade before the Conversation House , and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with fashionably dressed people of both sexes , who march back and forth past the great music-stand and look very much bored , though they make a show of feeling otherwise .
These invalids looked melancholy enough , limping about on their canes and crutches , and apparently brooding over all sorts of cheerless things .
If that is so , Providence must have foreseen that it would be so , and therefore filled the land with the healing baths .
`` I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing . ''
`` You may well say that .

The truth is , these copies were so common , so universal , in the shops and everywhere , that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually becomes to the harassed ear .
In Lucerne , too , the wood carvings of other sorts , which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home , soon began to fatigue us .
We grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around clock-faces , and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks , or lying upon them in family groups , or peering alertly up from behind them .
The first day , I would have bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if I had the money -- and I did buy three -- but on the third day the disease had run its course , I had convalesced , and was in the market once more -- trying to sell .
However , I had no luck ; which was just as well , for the things will be pretty enough , no doubt , when I get them home .
The storm was raging , the thick snow blowing in gusts .
said he had n't time to take anything to eat , he only had a little claim against the government to collect , would run across the way , to the Treasury , and fetch the money , and then get right along back to Tennessee , for he was in considerable of a hurry .
An hour 's sail brought us to Lucerne again .
I judged it best to go to bed and rest several days , for I knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of Europe on foot must take care of himself .
I am not meaning to be flippant and irreverent , I am only meaning to be truthful .
One would think he would at least learn how to read the Lord 's Prayer , by and by , but it is not so .
He races through it as if he thought the quicker he got it in , the sooner it would be answered .

Guides ARE necessary , for none but a native can read those finger-boards .
A few minutes later , a sharp-eyed lad ran into the Monte Rosa Hotel , at Zermatt , saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of the Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier .
The boy was reproved for telling idle stories ; he was right , nevertheless , and this was what he saw .
He adds that if Taugwalder had had the disposition to cut the rope , he would not have had time to do it , the accident was so sudden and unexpected .

At this point it is like a sea whose deep swales and long , rolling swells have been caught in mid-movement and frozen solid ; but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows of ice .
`` My father , I have a feeling that the dear Virgin will come to our help .

I said to the miner , `` Why , my dear sir , these were not the gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage ; these were impostors . ''
They make the sacrifice freely .
I fell visibly in their respect and esteem , and I should have fallen in my own , except that I had already struck bottom , and there was n't any place to fall to .
I wish to quote some of the things he said .
I wish to imagine him arraigning Mr. Croker and Tammany before the voters of New York City and pleading with them for the overthrow of that combined iniquity of the 5th of November , and will substitute for `` My Lords , '' read `` Fellow-Citizens '' ; for `` Kingdom , '' read `` City '' ; for `` Parliamentary Process , '' read `` Political Campaign '' ; for `` Two Houses , '' read `` Two Parties , '' and so it reads :
Have you ever thought about this ?
Yes ; but patriotism is usually the refuge of the scoundrel .
The deep-thinkers did n't merely laugh when that happened .
They stopped to think , and said `` There 's a rising man .
The commercial advantages of a great nation lie there in that man 's keeping .
We no longer require a man to take care of our moral character before the world .
AT A BANQUET GIVEN MR. H. H. ROGERS BY THE BUSINESS MEN OF NORFOLK , VA. , CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE VIRGINIAN RAILWAY , APRIL , 3 , 1909
Anthony Hope introduced Mr. Clemens to make the response to the toast `` Literature . ''
Still , I was born generous .
There could not be a broader platform than mine .
I am in favor of anything and everything -- of temperance and intemperance , morality and qualified immorality , gold standard and free silver .
Is n't it merely to convey ideas and emotions ?
Here is a letter written by a woman , right out of her heart of hearts .
The spelling is her own .
There is n't a waste letter in it anywhere .
Before many seconds Mrs. Winton saw it was time to change her temperature .
In five minutes I had asked the man to luncheon , and she to dinner , and so on .
That boy was a deep student in the history of Anglo-Saxon liberty , and he was a patriot all the way through to the marrow .
Other subjects were of no concern to Jack , but that quaint , inscrutable innocence of his I could not get Williams to put into the picture .
`` Oh , that 's nothing , '' I said , `` I was born discrepantly . ''
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN , -- I am but human , and when you , give me a reception like that I am obliged to wait a little while I get my voice .
I do not want to compliment Admiral Harrington , but as long as such men as he devote their lives to the public service the credit of the country will never cease .
I will say that the same high qualities , the same moral and intellectual attainments , the same graciousness of manner , of conduct , of observation , and expression have caused Admiral Harrington to be mistaken for me -- and I have been mistaken for him .
But it woke him up .
I was grateful to have company on any terms .
He lit a match , and there I was , way down south when I ought to have been back up yonder .
My bed was out of sight it was so far away .
Well , that 's no matter -- there 's plenty of other things to do , and we must think of something else .
thy name -- I don't know what thy name is -- Thompson will do -- any name will do -- but you see there is the fact , there is the consistency .
Then we have tried for governor an illustrious Rough Rider , and we liked him so much in that great office that now we have made him Vice-President -- not in order that that office shall give him distinction , but that he may confer distinction upon that office .
And now , for a while anyway , we shall not be stammering and embarrassed when a stranger asks us , `` What is the name of the Vice-President ? ''
Why , I could have been a Rough Rider myself if I had known that this political Klondike was going to open up , and I would have been a Rough Rider if I could have gone to war on an automobile but not on a horse !
No , I know the horse too well ; I have known the horse in war and in peace , and there is no place where a horse is comfortable .
I say it not with my lips only , but from the heart .
At the end of the party a great dignitary of the English Established Church went away half an hour before anybody else and carried off my hat .
He went out first , and of course had the choice of hats .
The result was that the whole afternoon I was under the influence of his clerical hat and could not tell a lie .
The American Society in London gave a banquet , July 4 , 1907 , at the Hotel Cecil .
Ambassador Choate called on Mr. Clemens to respond to the toast `` The Day We Celebrate . ''
Let the men rest three hours longer .
`` Very well , we have found them ; shall we fight them ? ''
We shall come to the Bloodless March presently ( and the Coronation ) .
It was the victorious long march which Joan made through the enemy's country from Gien to Rheims , and thence to the gates of Paris , capturing every English town and fortress that barred the road , from the beginning of the journey to the end of it ; and this by the mere force of her name , and without shedding a drop of blood -- perhaps the most extraordinary campaign in this regard in history -- this is the most glorious of her military exploits .
That pious fox the Chancellor of France took the word now .
He washed his soft hands together , smiling persuasively , and said to Joan :
Joan made her good-byes to those old fellows in the morning , with loving embraces and many tears , and with a packed multitude for sympathizers , and they rode proudly away on their precious horses to carry their great news home .
She was brimming with enthusiasm .
She said she would be carried before the gate in the morning , and in half an hour Paris would be ours without any question .
Now that will remind you of an earlier prophecy of Joan 's .
A good point for Cauchon if he could eventually make it appear that these were no saints to whom she had done reverence , but devils in disguise .
She had lifted France out of the mud and moved her to strike for freedom , and led her to victory after victory -- hence she was a disturber of the peace -- as indeed she was , and a provoker of war -- as indeed she was again !
and France will be proud of it and grateful for it for many a century to come .
And she had been adored -- as if she could help that , poor thing , or was in any way to blame for it .
The cowed veteran and the wavering recruit had drunk the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her sword with theirs and moved forward invincible -- hence she was a sorceress .
`` Have you anything further to say ? ''
She gasped and staggered up out of her seat muttering and mumbling incoherently , and gazed vacantly upon the people and the scene about her like one who is dazed , or thinks he dreams , and does not know where he is .
Nobody was able to stir or speak for a while , so paralyzing was the universal astonishment , so unbelievable the fact that the stake was actually standing there unoccupied and its prey gone .
The press grew thicker and thicker in the streets , the excitement grew higher and higher .
Then it began to sprinkle rain , and we could hear the professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather .
But Tom he was huffy , and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant blatherskites , and then he says :
`` I tell you , this has n't got anything to do with shirts .
We cut the breakfast pretty short , we was so impatient .
As we slanted along down , the weather began to moderate , and pretty soon we shed our furs .
But it kept ON moderating , and in a precious little while it was 'most too moderate .
WE went a-fooling along for a day or two , and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert , we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face .
It was another caravan .
Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries , the first we ever see , and very tall , and they go plunging along like they was on stilts , and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable , I bet you , but they make noble good time , and a camel ai n't nowheres with them for speed .
There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once , and had a picture of them , and made a speech , and said the biggest pyramid covered thirteen acres , and was most five hundred foot high , just a steep mountain , all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau , and laid up in perfectly regular layers , like stair-steps .
Thirteen acres , you see , for just one building ; it 's a farm .
It ai n't any trouble , because it 's the first land you 'll strike the other side of the Atlantic .
Away up to your left you 'll see another thread coming in -- that 's the Missouri and is a little above St. Louis .
`` Ef it 's dat easy , Mars Tom , I reckon we kin do it -- yassir , I knows we kin . ''
`` We 'll hunt for them , sir . ''
They wanted me to explain , but I was tired .
`` I do n't mean sell it .
I mean have an income from it .
Its owner finds four silver groschen in his pocket every morning . ''
Then I caught my breath , for we were there .
We were simple folk , in our village , and when a stranger was a pleasant person we were soon friends .
Marget wondered how we got in without her hearing us .
Traum said the door was open , and we walked in and waited until she should turn around and greet us .
That gratified me , and made me proud .
She said she hoped their two uncles would meet , some day .
It made me shudder .
I was thinking to myself that I should like to see what the inside of the jail was like ; Satan overheard the thought , and the next moment we were in the jail .
We were in the torture-chamber , Satan said .
There were people there -- and executioners -- but as they took no notice of us , it meant that we were invisible .
A young man lay bound , and Satan said he was suspected of being a heretic , and the executioners were about to inquire into it .
They asked the man to confess to the charge , and he said he could not , for it was not true .
Then they drove splinter after splinter under his nails , and he shrieked with the pain .
Satan was not disturbed , but I could not endure it , and had to be whisked out of there .
I was faint and sick , but the fresh air revived me , and we walked toward my home .
I said it was a brutal thing .
Marget was enduring her forsakenness and isolation fairly well , all things considered , and was cheerful , by help of Wilhelm Meidling .
She spent an hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle , and had fattened him up with the cat 's contributions .
Ursula was curious about him herself , and asked a good many questions about his uncle .
I said I knew he did not mean any harm , but that he ought to stop and consider the possible consequences of a thing before launching it in that impulsive and random way of his ; then he would not make so much trouble .
He was not hurt by this plain speech ; he only looked amused and surprised , and said :
It is because they can not see into the future .
What I am doing for the villagers will bear good fruit some day ; in some cases to themselves ; in others , to unborn generations of men .
No one will ever know that I was the cause , but it will be none the less true , for all that .
Among you boys you have a game : you stand a row of bricks on end a few inches apart ; you push a brick , it knocks its neighbor over , the neighbor knocks over the next brick -- and so on till all the row is prostrate .
