`` That sounds rather dull , '' Katharine remarked .
He called her `` she , '' which was a proof of it .
Denham had accused Katharine Hilbery of belonging to one of the most distinguished families in England , and if any one will take the trouble to consult Mr. Galton 's `` Hereditary Genius , '' he will find that this assertion is not far from the truth .
They say Switzerland 's very lovely in the snow , except for the cold .
Now let me see -- ''
`` In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry -- ''
`` He 's misunderstood every word I said ! ''
It had been crammed with assertions that such-and-such passages , taken liberally from English , French , and Italian , are the supreme pearls of literature .
Further , he was fond of using metaphors which , compounded in the study , were apt to sound either cramped or out of place as he delivered them in fragments .
As they sat down they turned almost invariably to the person sitting next them , and rectified and continued what they had just said in public .
`` I asked her to pity me , and she teases me ! ''
`` I wonder what they 're making such a noise about ? ''
Perhaps not , '' Katharine replied .
It was a habit that spoke of loneliness and a mind thinking for itself .
`` Surely you do n't think that a proof of cleverness ?
`` Mary Datchet , '' said Mary .
`` It 's not such an imposing name as Katharine Hilbery , I 'm afraid . ''
He observed that when a pedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came together again directly afterwards .
When they had crossed the road , Rodney slapped his hand upon the stone parapet above the river and exclaimed :
Trust me , Katharine , '' he added hastily , `` I wo n't speak of it again .
-- one feels -- one feels -- Perhaps if you married me -- I 'm half a poet , you see , and I ca n't pretend not to feel what I do feel .
If I could write -- ah , that would be another matter .
Katharine stood for a moment quite still .
William felt in the mood for a short soliloquy of indignation , for Katharine had contrived to exasperate him in more ways than one .
`` Who 's taken you in now ? ''
`` If you mean that I should n't do anything good with leisure if I had it , I dare say you 're right .
But I should be ten times as happy with my whole day to spend as I liked . ''
`` That is what you can do , '' she went on , moving on to the next statue .
Nevertheless , before she left the Museum she was very far from saying , even in the privacy of her own mind , `` I am in love with you , '' and that sentence might very well never have framed itself .
The street lamps were being lit already , and as she stood still for a moment beneath one of them , she tried to think of some neighboring drawing-room where there would be firelight and talk congenial to her mood .
That mood , owing to the spinning traffic and the evening veil of unreality , was ill-adapted to her home surroundings .
Perhaps , on the whole , a shop was the best place in which to preserve this queer sense of heightened existence .
She found herself in a dimly lighted hall , unguarded by a porter , and pushed open the first swing door .
A voice from within shouted , `` No .
`` If we had known Miss Hilbery was coming , we should have bought a cake , '' said Mary , upon which Mrs. Seal looked at Katharine for the first time , suspiciously , because she was a person who needed cake .
`` We fine her a penny each time she forgets , and the fines go to buying a plum cake , '' she explained , seeking to draw Katharine into the community .
`` Oh , it 's only Mr .
she cried , without any attempt to conceal her disappointment .
To him , she supposed , Mary Datchet , composing leaflets for Cabinet Ministers among her typewriters , represented all that was interesting and genuine ; and , accordingly , she shut them both out from all share in the crowded street , with its pendant necklace of lamps , its lighted windows , and its throng of men and women , which exhilarated her to such an extent that she very nearly forgot her companion .
But she got up in spite of him , and said good-bye with her usual air of decision , and left him with a quickness which Ralph connected now with all her movements .
He looked down and saw her standing on the pavement edge , an alert , commanding figure , which waited its season to cross , and then walked boldly and swiftly to the other side .
That gesture and action would be added to the picture he had of her , but at present the real woman completely routed the phantom one .
I never saw such queer-looking people .
`` What in the name of conscience did he do it for ? ''
Mr. Hilbery had now placed his hat on his head , and his hand was on the door-knob .
He waved his hand once to his daughter , and was gone .
The superb stiff folds of the crinolines suited the women ; the cloaks and hats of the gentlemen seemed full of character .
`` Ah , you wretch ! ''
'Maggie , ' she used to say , 'if it had n't been for me , where would you be now ? '
I fancy , '' Mrs. Hilbery mused , `` that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which , with all your outspokenness , you have n't got . ''
Mrs. Milvain said , laying a slight emphasis upon Cyril .
Celia has doubtless told you .
Growing weary of it all , Katharine turned to the window , and stood among the folds of the curtain , pressing close to the window-pane , and gazing disconsolately at the river much in the attitude of a child depressed by the meaningless talk of its elders .
And then Mrs. Hilbery was struck by a better idea .
It was true that Mary 's reading had been rather limited to such works as she needed to know for the sake of examinations ; and her time for reading in London was very little .
For some reason , no one likes to be told that they do not read enough poetry , but her resentment was only visible in the way she changed the position of her hands , and in the fixed look in her eyes .
I had you in my mind often when I was writing those scenes .
And I 'd rather -- yes , I really believe I 'd rather -- you thought well of my writing than any one in the world . ''
A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room , and observed that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew where they could find a fishmonger 's shop still open .
She breathed deeply a sigh of relief .
and then I thought ( in that hopeless , dreary way one does think , with the fire going out and one 's birthday just over ) , 'Why should I lay my troubles on HER ? '
And then she told me how , after all , she had made up her mind .
She expected him to-morrow .
At first I was n't glad at all .
I 'm very happy . '
And , after all , it would be far more horrid if she did n't marry -- or suppose she married some one we could n't endure ?
As upon that first occasion , some weeks ago , the door closed as if it were a thousand doors softly excluding the world ; and once more Ralph received an impression of a room full of deep shadows , firelight , unwavering silver candle flames , and empty spaces to be crossed before reaching the round table in the middle of the room , with its frail burden of silver trays and china teacups .
And in five minutes she had filled the shell of the old dream with the flesh of life ; looked with fire out of phantom eyes .
He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables ; they were solid , for he grasped the back of the chair in which Katharine had sat ; and yet they were unreal ; the atmosphere was that of a dream .
A curious change came over her face , as if the flame of her mind were subdued ; and she looked at him ironically and with the expression which he had called sad before , for want of a better name for it .
`` That was what his father , old Sir Richard , always called him .
`` It was at Tenby that you were chased by the bull , '' Mrs. Milvain continued .
`` But that you could n't remember , though it 's true you were a wonderful child .
When she ought to have been attending to the baby , her eyes were on the sea .
And Mrs. Hilbery allowed this girl -- Susan her name was -- to have him to stay in the village .
He looked at her , but her face showed that she was not thinking of him .
`` Miss Markham has already arrived , '' Mrs. Seal remarked , with due solemnity , `` and this is her dog . ''
She seemed a compound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine ; less poetically speaking , she showed both gentleness and strength , an indefinable promise of soft maternity blending with her evident fitness for honest labor .
Nevertheless , she had great difficulty in reducing her mind to obedience ; and her reading lacked conviction , as if , as was indeed the case , she had lost the power of visualizing what she read .
And directly the list was completed , her mind floated to Lincoln 's Inn Fields and the fluttering wings of innumerable sparrows .
Was Ralph still enticing the bald-headed cock-sparrow to sit upon his hand ?
Would he ever succeed ?
Consider it , she must , when the committee was over .
As if emerging from a mist , the old foes of the public good loomed ahead of her -- capitalists , newspaper proprietors , anti-suffragists , and , in some ways most pernicious of all , the masses who take no interest one way or another -- among whom , for the time being , she certainly discerned the features of Ralph Denham .
Indeed , when Miss Markham asked her to suggest the names of a few friends of hers , she expressed herself with unusual bitterness :
-- at once ! ''
`` It was a good meeting -- did n't you think so , Sally ? ''
They had their tea , and went over many of the points that had been raised in the committee rather more intimately than had been possible then ; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in some way behind the scenes ; of having their hands upon strings which , when pulled , would completely change the pageant exhibited daily to those who read the newspapers .
`` We have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery , '' said Katharine , apparently paying no attention to William , and accepting a cigarette which Mary offered her .
William answered , delighted , Mary guessed , at this little compliment .
`` Why , I always travel with a notebook .
You must meet him .
We 'll ask him to lunch .
And this not caring about art , '' he explained , turning to Mary , `` it 's one of Katharine 's poses , Miss Datchet .
Did you know she posed ?
She pretends that she 's never read Shakespeare .
Constrained , perhaps , by nervousness , Rodney continued in the same vein .
These people , though they seem young enough , look so angular and so crude that they remind him of the little pictures painted by monks in the capital letters of their manuscripts .
But when he looked out of the window , it was of her he thought ; she , too , had seen these gray fields , and , perhaps , she was there where the trees ran up a slope , and one yellow light shone now , and then went out again , at the foot of the hill .
The light shone in the windows of an old gray house , he thought .
She brooded over the gray fields , and was with him now in the railway carriage , thoughtful , silent , and infinitely tender ; but the vision pressed too close , and must be dismissed , for the train was slackening .
Its abrupt jerks shook him wide awake , and he saw Mary Datchet , a sturdy russet figure , with a dash of scarlet about it , as the carriage slid down the platform .
`` This is the sort of country I thought you 'd live in , Mary , '' he said , pushing his hat back on his head , and looking about him .
No gentlemen 's seats . ''
`` You would n't have much chance in London , I suppose , '' said Christopher .
`` But wo n't you find it rather dull -- just watching us ? ''
He had a fine head , the brow arched in the Elizabethan manner , but the gentle , honest eyes were rather skeptical than glowing with the Elizabethan vigor .
said Henry , the malicious mood now predominating .
`` I do n't think I ever do consider things like the stars , '' Henry replied .
`` I 'm not sure that that 's not the explanation , though , '' he added , now observing her steadily .
`` No more do I , '' she replied .
It was clear that his temper was ruffled .
`` I can quite understand that , '' said Rodney , with his little chuckle , leaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly with his fingers .
You 're a great huntsman , are n't you ?
`` Not Katharine , '' said Henry , with decision .
Mind , I 'm out all day . ''
The morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas in Lady Otway 's private sitting-room appear more than usually shabby , and the gallant gentlemen , her brothers and cousins , who had defended the Empire and left their bones on many frontiers , looked at the world through a film of yellow which the morning light seemed to have drawn across their photographs .
Katharine unwittingly increased her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting-needles too .
seemed now to need , the door opened , and Mrs. Hilbery came in , or rather , did not come in , but stood in the doorway and smiled , having evidently mistaken the room .
`` But what hour would you like the carriage this morning ? ''
She wished to bring the talk back to marriage again , in order to hear Aunt Charlotte's views , but she did not know how to do this .
`` Yes , '' said Ralph , slackening his pace and remembering Katharine and her engagement , the purple leaves stamped into the path , the white paper radiant under the electric light , and the hopelessness which seemed to surround all these things .
`` You 're right , Mary , '' he said , with something of an effort , `` though I do n't know how you guessed it . ''
`` It seemed to me meaningless . ''
Katharine nodded her head .
The return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home had been in the morning ; indeed , Mrs. Hilbery leant back with closed eyes in her corner , and either slept or feigned sleep , as her habit was in the intervals between the seasons of active exertion , or continued the story which she had begun to tell herself that morning .
And yet , when she speaks to me like that !
What would make her care for me ? ''
The virility of this deed impressed her ; and yet , normally , she attached no value to the power of opening gates .
The strength of muscles has nothing to do on the face of it with the strength of affections ; nevertheless , she felt a sudden concern for this power running to waste on her account , which , combined with a desire to keep possession of that strangely attractive masculine power , made her rouse herself from her torpor .
Their old friendship and its firm base upon indestructible qualities of character crumbled , and her whole past seemed foolish , herself weak and credulous , and Ralph merely the shell of an honest man .
Oh , the past -- so much made up of Ralph ; and now , as she saw , made up of something strange and false and other than she had thought it .
Something about truth was in it ; how to see the truth is our great chance in this world .
`` Yes , we can still be friends , '' she said , with what firmness she could muster .
Her vision seemed to lay out the lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied her sense of harmony .
It only needed a persistent effort of thought , stimulated in this strange way by the crowd and the noise , to climb the crest of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever .
Of this process , which was to her so full of effort , which comprised infinitely swift and full passages of thought , leading from one crest to another , as she shaped her conception of life in this world , only two articulate words escaped her , muttered beneath her breath -- '' Not happiness -- not happiness . ''
The telephone-bell rang , and as she hurried off to answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance by itself , she felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface of the globe that all the subterranean wires of thought and progress came together .
She could not conceive in what respects Katharine , who spoke sincerely , could envy her .
`` I do n't know what he means to do , '' she said hurriedly , seeking time against the pressure of her own conviction .
But if she did keep something of her own ?
`` It 's a shabby old dress , '' said Katharine , and the only sign that Mary's words had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk .
She ought to be given the chance of hearing good music , as it is played by those who have inherited the great tradition .
Moreover , from one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation , he thought it possible that she had what Katharine professed to lack , a passionate , if untaught , appreciation of literature .
A moment later it was plain that he had been mistaken , it was not Katharine ; but he could not settle himself to his letter .
But this possibility , after all , was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every tick of the clock that Katharine had completely forgotten her engagement .
Was she well dressed ?
`` I do n't see why it should n't last with you , '' she resumed .
`` I can imagine a certain sort of person -- '' she paused ; she was aware that he was listening with the greatest intentness , and that his formality was merely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort .
There was some person then -- some woman -- who could it be ?
`` You could get rooms here , no doubt , if you wanted to , '' Rodney replied .
`` But I 'm just leaving London for good -- I 've taken that cottage I was telling you about . ''
`` Where is the cottage you 've taken ? ''
In answering her , Denham turned and looked at her .
She must get through the matter in hand , and then think it out in quiet .
She had forgotten to answer .
But directly she took up the conversation , it was William's turn to fall silent .
Then , as he was turning over means by which he could speak to her alone , she rose , and he was taken by surprise , for he had counted on the fact that she would outstay Denham .
Denham got up from his chair , looked at Katharine , and said :
`` I 'm going , too .
The Strand was too busy .
But the longer they walked thus alone , the more he was disturbed by the sense of her actual presence .
She stopped and , looking round her for a cab , sighted one in the distance .
Katharine exclaimed , in surprise .
`` We do n't know each other -- we 've always been -- interrupted ... .
Were you going to tell me this that day my aunts came ? ''
I thought of you as a person who judges -- ''
She took her letter to Cassandra with her , meaning to post it in the first pillar-box she came to .
Then the questioners paused for a moment , and resumed as if another side of the problem had just come to their notice .
Do you consider that he is in love with you ?
Is it right to consent to a solitary walk with him , and what advice are you going to give him about his future ?
Has William Rodney cause to be jealous of your conduct , and what do you propose to do about Mary Datchet ?
`` You do n't trust me ? ''
Why not tell her now , indeed , under pledge of secrecy ? ''
`` Katharine , you mind ?
He made an impatient sound .
One needn't cajole them ; one 's under no obligation to them .
`` In the first place , such a friendship must be unemotional , '' he laid it down emphatically .
Neither is under any obligation to the other .
They must be able to say whatever they wish to say .
`` There 's William , and , I believe , Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Aubrey . ''
From this point they proceeded to go over , as far as memory served them , the different aspects of Rodney 's drama .
Mrs. Hilbery thought to herself that she had never seen him to such advantage ; yes , he was somehow different ; he reminded her of some one who was dead , some one who was distinguished -- she had forgotten his name .
`` I confess I do n't understand the Russians . ''
They sat down , and Katharine , turning when she reached the window , saw William with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open , as if ready to speak the moment Cassandra ceased .
He had been quick .
He had come down from one of the Universities not long ago , and was now charged with the reformation of society .
Neither of them realized that the talk had already lasted three hours .
`` You 've been dining out ? ''
`` What d'you mean -- about us ? ''
I do n't want that .
`` I 'll go on where I left off , '' he said .
she asked , as they walked upstairs side by side .
`` Well , I think he is a little , '' Cassandra replied .
`` I 'll ask him , '' she replied , turning her head to look for him .
But he and Cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more .
No display of anger could have hurt his feelings more profoundly .
`` They 're mostly in on Sundays .
Ralph walked straight to the far end of the table .
`` You see , Miss Hilbery , my children all come in at different hours and want different things .
What else can you expect ?
She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she expressed unpopular views , and that her children disagreed with her .
`` Because Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep out .
Katharine went over the argument in her mind , remembering how , now and then , it had been set conspicuously on the right course by some remark offered either by James or by Johnnie .
We shall gain nothing but unhappiness .
He looked at her .
`` I assure you that I 'm far more ordinary than I appear .
In fact , the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid .
I 'm not that , but I 'm a matter-of-fact , prosaic , rather ordinary character ; I order the dinner , I pay the bills , I do the accounts , I wind up the clock , and I never look at a book . ''
But I shall gain more than I lose . ''
`` You wo n't be lonely then , '' he said .
`` According to what people say , marriage is a very queer business .
They say it 's different from anything else .
But she made no reply .
`` It 's not that , '' he said impatiently .
`` Our compact is going to hold in spite of all I 've said ? ''
`` And forgetting your purse , '' Ralph added .
The desire to share what he felt , with some one who understood it , was so imperious that he did not question it .
Mary came to the door after a moment 's pause .
`` But do you care for William ? ''
`` But why -- I do n't understand -- you 're not engaged ! ''
`` Oh , that explains it !
You do n't want to marry him ! ''
`` Ah , Cassandra is still with you , '' she remarked .
That is why I have come this morning .
`` Yes , '' said Katharine , standing up , `` I 'm so angry that I do n't want to say anything more .
I let you persuade me in a moment of madness .
`` She wished even to persecute Cassandra ! ''
People are talking about us .
She was right to tell us .
It only confirms my own feeling -- the position is monstrous . ''
She was confused , agitated , physically tired , and had already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings .
`` She loves you . ''
`` I shall never ask that , '' said Katharine .
She moved a little away from where they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers .
Have I been very selfish ? ''
Cassandra 's words seemed to rub the old blurred image of life and freshen it so marvelously that it looked new again .
She turned to William .
she asked , holding it out .
`` But I 'm fearfully serious , '' said Cassandra , with a little shudder , and her look showed that she spoke the truth .
There was fear in her glance , which darted on her and then dropped guiltily .
She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had suffered in the whole of her life ; she learnt more of her capacities for feeling .
But when Katharine reappeared she was calm , and had gained a look of dignity that was new to her .
What has William told you about Ralph Denham ? ''
`` Now , when are you and William going to be married ? ''
I 'm in my right senses now . ''
Suddenly , together , at the same moment , they said good-bye .
She ran downstairs on the crest of it .
She was amazed to find herself already committed by William and Cassandra to marry the owner of the halting voice she had just heard on the telephone .
She had only to look at Cassandra to see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means .
She considered for a moment , and then said : `` If you do n't want to tell people yourselves , I 'll do it for you .
I know William has feelings about these matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything . ''
-- rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were too foolish to be named .
Then she started ; then she awoke to the fact that Cassandra was looking at her in amazement .
She left the room , holding her unfinished bread and butter in her hand .
She saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of the situation .
She controlled herself , sat down , poured out a fresh cup of tea , and sipped it quietly .
This natural action , arguing complete self-mastery , and showing her in one of those feminine attitudes which William found adorable , did more than any argument to compose his agitation .
She applied her ear to the telephone once more .
He wo n't be back to dinner . ''
`` It 's far more likely that he 'll come here , '' said Mary , and Katharine , after considering for a moment , said :
`` Yes , his father died some years ago , '' said Mr. Hilbery , who was prepared to draw upon his imagination , if necessary , to keep Mrs. Milvain supplied with facts about the private history of Ralph Denham since , for some inscrutable reason , the subject took her fancy .
Mr. Hilbery swayed to and fro , and moved his lips as if to utter remarks which remained unspoken .
`` You 've had some difference of opinion , eh ?
Her uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity , and still talked over her head as if she did not exist .
`` For God 's sake , Katharine , control yourself ! ''
What was she doing now , he wondered , as he addressed the envelope to his wife .
He could not play the spy .
She might be making any arrangements she chose .
His sense of discomfort was almost physical .
Hastily Mrs. Hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary house , and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between Keats and Coleridge in a lane , which tided over the discomfort of the moment , and drew Katharine on to further descriptions and indiscretions .
By degrees , a pulse or stress began to beat at regular intervals in his mind , heaping his thoughts into waves to which words fitted themselves , and without much consciousness of what he was doing , he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what had the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line .
Not many lines had been set down , however , before he threw away his pen as violently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds , and tore the paper into many separate pieces .
This was a sign that Katharine had asserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met poetically .
The physical distance increased his desperation .
He began pacing in circles until the process sickened him , and then took a sheet of paper for the composition of a letter which , he vowed before he began it , should be sent that same evening .
It was a strange drive .
For Denham it was without exception the most unpleasant he had ever taken .
After some minutes , Mrs. Hilbery realized the situation , and accepted it good-humoredly , apologizing to Ralph for his disappointment .
Remarkably enough , the ring had rolled to the very point where he stood .
He saw the rubies touching the tip of his boot .
Such is the force of habit that he could not refrain from stooping , with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at being the one to find what others were looking for , and , picking the ring up , he presented it , with a bow that was courtly in the extreme , to Cassandra .
Whether the making of a bow released automatically feelings of complaisance and urbanity , Mr. Hilbery found his resentment completely washed away during the second in which he bent and straightened himself .
Mrs. Hilbery seemed to have been waiting for the entrance of her husband , and for this precise moment in order to put to him a question which , from the ardor with which she announced it , had evidently been pressing for utterance for some time past .
Katharine stood where he left her , looking at the window and expecting soon to see a shadow move across it ; but she saw nothing ; the blinds conveyed nothing ; the light was not moved .
She brandished her happiness as if in salute ; she dipped it as if in reverence .
`` How they burn ! ''
They dismounted and walked down to the river .
She felt his arm stiffen beneath her hand , and knew by this token that they had entered the enchanted region .
What woman did he see ?
Moments , fragments , a second of vision , and then the flying waters , the winds dissipating and dissolving ; then , too , the recollection from chaos , the return of security , the earth firm , superb and brilliant in the sun .
On a June night the nightingales sing , they answer each other across the plain ; they are heard under the window among the trees in the garden .
Some three months later it happened that I was sitting alone when Castalia entered .
I exclaimed , as she sat down .
`` To -- to -- answer questions , '' she replied in some confusion .
But in the middle of an account which interested and excited me more than anything I had ever heard , she gave the strangest cry , half whoop , half holloa --
Because , '' she added , `` I have to confess that I am an impure woman . ''
Is she impure ? ''
Jane rapped the table .
He is beautiful to look at ; he gives himself no airs ; he understands the meaning of art and literature instinctively ; he goes about enjoying his life and making other people enjoy theirs .
Then they teach him to cultivate his intellect .
He becomes a barrister , a civil servant , a general , an author , a professor .
Or that the least insect in Japan has a name twice the length of its body ?
It is our only chance .
For unless we provide them with some innocent occupation we shall get neither good people nor good books ; we shall perish beneath the fruits of their unbridled activity ; and not a human being will survive to know that there once was Shakespeare ! ''
Down they get ( Bob and Barbara ) , hold out hands stiffly ; back again to their chairs , staring between the resumed mouthfuls .
`` Why _should_ she twitch ? ''
Skip , skip , till we reach the landing on the upper floor ; stairs brass-bound ; linoleum worn ; oh , yes !
Now , Minnie , the door 's shut ; Hilda heavily descends to the basement ; you unstrap the straps of your basket , lay on the bed a meagre nightgown , stand side by side furred felt slippers .
Some methodical disposition of hat-pins .
Three o'clock on a December afternoon ; the rain drizzling ; one light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium ; another high in a servant 's bedroom -- this one goes out .
A moment 's blankness -- then , what are you thinking ?
That's all very well ; and she may rub the pane too , as though to see God better ; but what God does she see ?
I , too , see roofs , I see sky ; but , oh , dear -- this seeing of Gods !
Is that why she prays ?
All her sins fall , fall , for ever fall .
The spot receives them .
`` Bob at lunch to-day '' -- But elderly women are the worst .
She 'll even lock the bathroom door overnight , too , though it 's only cold water you want , and sometimes when the night's been bad it seems as if washing helped .
How the children stare !
Well , then home a back way -- '' Home a back way ! ''
But here 's a jerk .
That 's what always happens !
Tethered to the shores of the world , none of the crimes , sorrows , rhapsodies , or insanities for poor Minnie Marsh ; never late for luncheon ; never caught in a storm without a mackintosh ; never utterly unconscious of the cheapness of eggs .
To what , to where ?
But what I can not thus eliminate , what I must , head down , eyes shut , with the courage of a battalion and the blindness of a bull , charge and disperse are , indubitably , the figures behind the ferns , commercial travellers .
There I 've hidden them all this time in the hope that somehow they 'd disappear , or better still emerge , as indeed they must , if the story 's to go on gathering richness and rotundity , destiny and tragedy , as stories should , rolling along with it two , if not three , commercial travellers and a whole grove of aspidistra .
James Moggridge travels in -- shall we say buttons ?
He travels , and on Thursdays , his Eastbourne day , takes his meals with the Marshes .
His red face , his little steady eyes -- by no means altogether commonplace -- his enormous appetite ( that 's safe ; he won't look at Minnie till the bread 's swamped the gravy dry ) , napkin tucked diamond-wise -- but this is primitive , and , whatever it may do the reader , do n't take me in .
Let 's dodge to the Moggridge household , set that in motion .
But no ; she 's of the unborn children of the mind , illicit , none the less loved , like my rhododendrons .
Here 's Minnie eating her egg at the moment opposite and at t'other end of the line -- are we past Lewes ?
I come irresistibly to lodge myself somewhere on the firm flesh , in the robust spine , wherever I can penetrate or find foothold on the person , in the soul , of Moggridge the man .
`` Marsh 's sister -- not a bit like Marsh ; wretched , elderly female ... .
You should feed your hens ... .
Dear , dear , dear !
Dear , dear ! ''
-- I do n't know though .
Off they go , down the road , side by side ... .
Well , my world 's done for !
Life's bare as bone .
What are you whispering ?
This time they were both men .
The younger of the two wore an expression of perhaps unnatural calm ; he raised his eyes and fixed them very steadily in front of him while his companion spoke , and directly his companion had done speaking he looked on the ground again and sometimes opened his lips only after a long pause and sometimes did not open them at all .
And yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all .
Mrs. Flanders stooped over him .
The wind rushed outside , but the small flame of the spirit-lamp burnt quietly , shaded from the cot by a book stood on edge .
Lying on one 's back one would have seen nothing but muddle and confusion -- clouds turning and turning , and something yellow-tinted and sulphurous in the darkness .
`` Some tumours have to be cut ; but the sort my mother had you bear with for years and years , and never even have a cup of tea brought up to you in bed . ''
Page , Mrs. Cranch , and Mrs. Garfit could see Mrs. Flanders in the orchard because the orchard was a piece of Dods Hill enclosed ; and Dods Hill dominated the village .
No words can exaggerate the importance of Dods Hill .
It was the earth ; the world against the sky ; the horizon of how many glances can best be computed by those who have lived all their lives in the same village , only leaving it once to fight in the Crimea , like old George Garfit , leaning over his garden gate smoking his pipe .
The progress of the sun was measured by it ; the tint of the day laid against it to be judged .
John kept trotting up and slapping down in her lap grass or dead leaves which he called `` tea , '' and she arranged them methodically but absent-mindedly , laying the flowery heads of the grasses together , thinking how Archer had been awake again last night ; the church clock was ten or thirteen minutes fast ; she wished she could buy Garfit's acre .
And he woke Rebecca , who had to be up so early .
`` Mrs. Flanders stepped out only five minutes ago , Captain , '' said Rebecca .
He is on the Bridge at night , '' and , handing him his cup , or whatever it might be , would run on to visions of shipwreck and disaster , in which all the passengers come tumbling from their cabins , and there is the captain , buttoned in his pea-jacket , matched with the storm , vanquished by it but by none other .
`` Yet I have a soul , '' Mrs. Jarvis would bethink her , as Captain Barfoot suddenly blew his nose in a great red bandanna handkerchief , `` and it 's the man's stupidity that 's the cause of this , and the storm 's my storm as well as his '' ... so Mrs. Jarvis would bethink her when the Captain dropped in to see them and found Herbert out , and spent two or three hours , almost silent , sitting in the arm-chair .
She looked out of the window .
She dwelt upon his mouth .
No , no , no !
But since , even at her age , she noted his indifference , presumably he was in some way or other -- to her at least -- nice , handsome , interesting , distinguished , well built , like her own boy ?
Now , though they had finished their meat , Mrs. Plumer took a second helping of cabbage .
She glanced at the mutton .
Poor old Huxtable ca n't walk straight ; -- Sopwith , too , has praised the sky any night these twenty years ; and Cowan still chuckles at the same stories .
How like a suburb where you go to see a view and eat a special cake !
`` We are the sole purveyors of this cake . ''
Back you go to London ; for the treat is over .
The whole flesh of his face then fell into folds as if props were removed .
The others had all gone .
But intimacy -- the room was full of it , still , deep , like a pool .
It 's Julian the Apostate .
`` It follows ... '' said Jacob .
`` Look -- she has to draw her water from a well in the garden . ''
Having drawn her water , Mrs. Pascoe went in .
The tourists regretted that they had brought no glasses , so that they might have read the name of the tramp steamer .
Two fishing luggers , presumably from St. Ives Bay , were now sailing in an opposite direction from the steamer , and the floor of the sea became alternately clear and opaque .
She owes me a sovereign . ''
`` That privilege will be mine , '' said the courtly Mr. Wortley , producing a silver case primed with sovereigns and slipping one coin on to the table .
Then Mrs. Durrant got up and passed down the room , holding herself very straight , and the girls in yellow and blue and silver gauze followed her , and elderly Miss Eliot in her velvet ; and a little rosy woman , hesitating at the door , clean , scrupulous , probably a governess .
`` Well , just now .
You 're NOT old . ''
At Mudie 's corner in Oxford Street all the red and blue beads had run together on the string .
The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other 's faces .
Each had his own business to think of .
Does it need an effort ?
The autumn season was in full swing .
It was the first time he had read his essay aloud .
`` Extremely awkward , '' she said , `` but so distinguished-looking . ''
`` This fellow Wagner '' ... distinction was one of the words to use naturally , though , from looking at him , one would have found it difficult to say which seat in the opera house was his , stalls , gallery , or dress circle .
There was something in the shape of his hands ( he was descended on his mother 's side from a family of the greatest antiquity and deepest obscurity ) which indicated taste .
But if one can not find it ?
Such is the manner of our seeing .
Life is thoroughly pleasant , although unfortunately there are a great number of fools about .
She prattled , sitting by the fireside , of famous painters .
Wild and frail and beautiful she looked , and thus the women of the Greeks were , Jacob thought ; and this was life ; and himself a man and Florinda chaste .
`` I will remove myself if you 'll kindly lend me a hand , '' said Mr. Salvin .
`` Very few people do that , '' said Mrs. Durrant .
Why is nobody taught anything that they ought to know , Sir Jasper ? ''
She left them standing against the wall .
A rude old lady , Jacob thought .
She felt motherly towards them .
`` Your breakfast , sir , '' she said , as they came near .
Altogether a most reasonable conversation ; a most respectable room ; an intelligent girl .
In short , something was wrong .
And she must study statistics .
There are more women than men .
Yes ; but if you let women work as men work , they 'll die off much quicker .
They 'll become extinct .
Death and gall and bitter dust were on her pen-tip ; and as the afternoon wore on , red had worked into her cheek-bones and a light was in her eyes .
Stuff them into the flame of Marlowe and burn them to cinders .
Let not a shred remain .
And to set that on foot read incredibly dull essays upon Marlowe to your friends .
`` Who is that ? ''
Fanny dropped on to the floor , clasped her hands round her knees , and looked at him , her beautiful eyes -- yes , beauty , flying through the room , shone there for a second .
And when the kettle boiled , up she scrambled , more like a colt or a puppy than a loving woman .
of the next comer .
She fetched her hand-glass .
And suppose one wreathed Jacob in a turban ?
And though he looked terrible and magnificent and would chuck the Forest , he said , and come to the Slade , and be a Turkish knight or a Roman emperor ( and he let her blacken his lips and clenched his teeth and scowled in the glass ) , still -- there lay Tom Jones .
`` He always gets like this , '' said Cruttendon irritably .
`` Yes , he 'll come with us , '' said Cruttendon .
`` Yes , I know .
They had to separate .
And there is a lonely hill-top where no one ever comes , and yet it is seen by me who was lately driving down Piccadilly on an omnibus .
Jacob went to the window and stood with his hands in his pockets .
Their lack of concern for him was not the cause of his gloom ; but some more profound conviction -- it was not that he himself happened to be lonely , but that all people are .
Jacob sat himself down in the quarry where the Greeks had cut marble for the theatre .
It is hot work walking up Greek hills at midday .
He stood on the exact spot where the great statue of Athena used to stand , and identified the more famous landmarks of the scene beneath .
Bonamy sat with Clara in the sunny front room with the barrel organ piping sweetly outside ; the water-cart going slowly along spraying the pavement ; the carriages jingling , and all the silver and chintz , brown and blue rugs and vases filled with green boughs , striped with trembling yellow bars .
Jacob , helping himself to this and that , answered intelligently , yet with a ring in his voice .
`` It is astonishing , '' said Jacob , in a gruff voice .
`` Let us go on , '' she insisted .
`` I suppose they leave the gates open ? ''
He was young -- a man .
And then Sandra was right when she judged him to be credulous as yet .
At forty it might be a different matter .
However , you might place beside them passages of the purest poetry in Shakespeare .
`` The Height of the season , '' said Bonamy .
Bonamy paused , moved a pebble ; then darted in with the rapidity and certainty of a lizard 's tongue .
`` Or could I not ? ''
she thought , putting the poems of Donne back in the bookcase .
`` One could n't make up one 's mind to come indoors , '' she wrote .
`` It seemed wicked to waste even a moment . ''
Another procession , without banners , was blocking Long Acre .
These houses were built , say , a hundred and fifty years ago .
`` Jenkinson of Peterhouse ? ''
At the same time he took a little parchment volume from his pocket and laid it on the table .
All the smoke and the houses had disappeared , and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and clear though pale in the early light .
The ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water , leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side .
Mrs. Ambrose drew her arm within her husband 's , and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate .
Down she looked into the depth of the sea .
No , Miss Rachel , they could _not_ be mended ; they 're only fit for dust sheets .
There was nothing for it but to descend and inspect a large pile of linen heaped upon a table .
`` Nonsense , Rachel , '' Aunt Lucy replied ; `` do n't say such foolish things , dear .
I 've travelled all over Europe with mine .
`` I ca n't imagine anything nicer than to sit out in the moonlight and listen to music -- only that sounds too like a schoolgirl !
You know , '' she said , turning to Helen , `` I do n't think music 's altogether good for people -- I 'm afraid not . ''
Clarissa asked , turning to Rachel .
`` Watts and Joachim -- they looked just like you and me . ''
There were bottles containing liquids ; there were trays , boxes , brushes , pins .
and the Schipperke as quick as a knife .
However , breakfast was over and Mrs. Dalloway was rising .
`` I always think religion 's like collecting beetles , '' she said , summing up the discussion as she went up the stairs with Helen .
`` Don't think I say that because I 'm his wife -- I see his faults more clearly than I see any one else 's .
What one wants in the person one lives with is that they should keep one at one 's best .
`` After the labours of legislation , I deserve sleep , '' said Richard .
Then he opened his eyes which wore for a second the queer look of a shortsighted person 's whose spectacles are lost .
It took him a moment to recover from the impropriety of having snored , and possibly grunted , before a young lady .
`` Walking -- riding -- yachting -- I suppose the most momentous conversations of my life took place while perambulating the great court at Trinity .
I was at both universities .
It was a fad of my father 's .
I can remember -- what an age ago it seems !
Crude as her manners seemed to him , Richard was flattered .
Quite suddenly the storm relaxed its grasp .
The monotonous order of plunging and rising , roaring and relaxing , was interfered with , and every one at table looked up and felt something loosen within them .
The strain was slackened and human feelings began to peep again , as they do when daylight shows at the end of a tunnel .
But Helen was not much interested in her brother-in-law .
`` That 's very bad for you , '' said Helen .
Richard twisted a muffler twice round his throat and struggled up on deck .
His body , which had grown white and tender in a dark room , tingled all over in the fresh air .
She drove open the door of her room and stepped into its calm .
Richard sat upon Bach .
`` Who was Burke ? ''
Helen started , looked at her , but could not make out what she felt .
Though , '' she added , `` he bored me considerably . ''
Helen was surprised to see how genuine both shock and problem were , but she could think of no way of easing the difficulty except by going on talking .
Helen meanwhile stitched at her embroidery and thought over the things they had said .
She found him sitting in his room working , applying a stout blue pencil authoritatively to bundles of filmy paper .
Papers lay to left and to right of him , there were great envelopes so gorged with papers that they spilt papers on to the table .
The need of sitting absolutely still before a Cockney photographer had given her lips a queer little pucker , and her eyes for the same reason looked as though she thought the whole situation ridiculous .
In his mind this work of his , the great factories at Hull which showed like mountains at night , the ships that crossed the ocean punctually , the schemes for combining this and that and building up a solid mass of industry , was all an offering to her ; he laid his success at her feet ; and was always thinking how to educate his daughter so that Theresa might be glad .
The reasons which had drawn the English across the sea to found a small colony within the last ten years are not so easily described , and will never perhaps be recorded in history books .
They returned in time for the summer term , when their stories of the splendours and hardships of life at sea , the humours of sea-captains , the wonders of night and dawn , and the marvels of the place delighted outsiders , and sometimes found their way into print .
Again , they declared that the natives were strangely beautiful , very big in stature , dark , passionate , and quick to seize the knife .
Somehow or other , as fashions do , the fashion spread ; an old monastery was quickly turned into a hotel , while a famous line of steamships altered its route for the convenience of passengers .
Often , leaning upon the column in the verandah , he had watched the English ships with English schoolmasters for pursers steaming into the bay .
They had made several expeditions though none of any length .
When have you ever encouraged a living artist ?
They talk to one as if they were equals .
As far as I can tell there are no aristocrats . ''
Helen laid hold of his beard .
Out here it seemed as though the people of England must be shaped in the body like the kings and queens , knights and pawns of the chessboard , so strange were their differences , so marked and so implicitly believed in .
the plump young woman cried , as she missed her stroke .
The game went on for a few minutes , and was then broken up by the approach of a wheeled chair , containing a voluminous old lady who paused by the table and said : --
She knelt in prayer , and then lay down in bed , tucking the blankets comfortably about her , and in a few minutes her breathing showed that she was asleep .
`` The women I saw to-night were not fat , '' said Hirst , who was taking advantage of Hewet 's company to cut his toe-nails .
`` But now they 're all types .
Don't take us , -- take this hotel .
`` That 's where you 'll go wrong , '' said Hirst .
`` Putting virgins among matrons . ''
Hewet retreated , pressing the poems of Thomas Hardy beneath his arm , and in their beds next door to each other both the young men were soon asleep .
`` At the age of eighty , Mr. Joshua Harris of Eeles Park , Brondesbury , has had a son , '' said Hirst .
`` Hewet will be our barometer , '' said Mr. Elliot .
`` He will melt before I shall . ''
The ladies were left alone now , surrounding _The_ _Times_ which lay upon the floor .
Miss Allan looked at her father 's watch .
I want both . ''
Mr. Venning was a dark young man , about thirty-two years of age , very slapdash and confident in his manner , although at this moment obviously a little excited .
He was a barrister also , but he loathed a profession which kept him indoors over books , and directly his widowed mother died he was going , so he confided to Susan , to take up flying seriously , and become partner in a large business for making aeroplanes .
It dealt , of course , with the beauties and singularities of the place , the streets , the people , and the quantities of unowned yellow dogs .
We met on the hill . ''
`` My wife 's brother , '' Ridley explained to Hilda , whom he failed to remember , `` has a house here , which he has lent us .
`` Our chicken got into the salt , '' Hewet said dolefully to Susan .
`` Nor is it true that bananas include moisture as well as sustenance . ''
`` Stay at home , '' said Ridley .
But , of course , they wo n't . ''
`` Come in , '' she said mechanically , for a string in her brain seemed to be pulled by a persistent knocking at the door .
Mrs. Elliot addressed the guide , who obligingly bowed his head .
`` It 's high time that horses should become extinct anyhow , '' said Hirst .
`` They 're distressingly ugly , besides being vicious . ''
But Susan , who had been brought up to understand that the horse is the noblest of God 's creatures , could not agree , and Venning thought Hirst an unspeakable ass , but was too polite not to continue the conversation .
said old Mr. Thornbury , putting on his spectacles to look at him .
`` They will not sting , but they may infest the victuals , '' said Miss Allan , and measures were taken at once to divert the ants from their course .
When an ant got through it was exposed to a fire of bread-crumbs , until Susan pronounced that that was cruel , and rewarded those brave spirits with spoil in the shape of tongue .
`` It would be no laughing matter really , '' said Mrs. Elliot confidentially to Mrs. Thornbury , `` if an ant did get between the vest and the skin . ''
They did not say much , but felt no constraint in being silent .
`` We must be very nice to him , Susan . ''
`` Just because they 're in love , '' said Hewet .
`` Did you congratulate the young couple ? ''
Hughling Elliot , who might have been expected to engage the old gentleman in argument , was absent at the moment .
He now came up holding out a large square of cotton upon which a fine design was printed in pleasant bright colours that made his hand look pale .
Suddenly some one cried , `` Ah ! ''
She stood still , looking at them , shivering slightly with anger and excitement .
She would have liked to discuss politics , which interested her more than personalities , but Mrs. Elliot would only talk about the Empire in a less abstract form .
`` I hear there are dreadful accounts from England about the rats , '' she said .
It attacks the rats , and through them other creatures . ''
`` I _am_ enjoying myself , '' she panted .
`` Movement -- is n't it amazing ? ''
St. John could not join in Helen 's laughter .
`` That 's not a light burning , is it ? ''
`` I have a key , '' said Hirst cryptically .
His chin was still upon his knees and his eyes fixed in front of him .
Hypnotised by the wings of the butterfly , and awed by the discovery of a terrible possibility in life , she sat for some time longer .
When the butterfly flew away , she rose , and with her two books beneath her arm returned home again , much as a soldier prepared for battle .
`` I do n't know how she did it , '' she continued , and ceased , and there was a long pause , in which a little owl called first here , then there , as it moved from tree to tree in the garden .
`` Who are you , what are you ; you see , I know nothing about you , '' he continued .
At last St. John exclaimed , `` Damn !
`` At Cambridge there are people to talk to . ''
`` About Miss Vinrace , '' he began , -- '' oh , look here , do let 's be St. John and Helen , and Rachel and Terence -- what 's she like ?
Does she reason , does she feel , or is she merely a kind of footstool ? ''
`` You 're absolutely happy , '' he proclaimed at last .
He noticed that she was wearing a dress of deep blue colour , made of a soft thin cotton stuff , which clung to the shape of her body .
Raising his eyes Hewet observed her head ; she had taken her hat off , and the face rested on her hand .
The expression was one of childlike intentness , as if she were watching for a fish to swim past over the clear red rocks .
She looked up suddenly .
`` So I observed , '' said Hewet .
`` That 's a thing that never ceases to amaze me . ''
He had recovered his composure to such an extent that he could light and smoke a cigarette , and feeling her ease , became happy and easy himself .
He might never care for any one ; all that desire to know her and get at her , which she had felt pressing on her almost painfully , had completely vanished .
It was now the height of the season , and every ship that came from England left a few people on the shores of Santa Marina who drove up to the hotel .
The fact that the Ambroses had a house where one could escape momentarily from the slightly inhuman atmosphere of an hotel was a source of genuine pleasure not only to Hirst and Hewet , but to the Elliots , the Thornburys , the Flushings , Miss Allan , Evelyn M. , together with other people whose identity was so little developed that the Ambroses did not discover that they possessed names .
It did not seem worth while to piece together so slight a friendship .
There were a great many arm-chairs and settees covered in brown holland , but each of these was occupied by a large square piece of yellow cardboard , and all the pieces of cardboard were dotted or lined with spots or dashes of bright oil paint .
At this moment the luncheon gong began to work itself into its midday frenzy .
`` The merest whisper would be sufficient to incriminate me for ever .
We 'd be free together .
No happiness would be like ours .
`` But I do n't suppose I 've had more than you 've had , '' Evelyn laughed rather insincerely .
`` Well , I do n't much believe in her , '' she remarked after a time in a low tone of voice .
She was now successful , and a lump of ginger emerged on the end of the button-hook .
For answer Rachel threw it out of the window .
`` Twenty-six years ? ''
She slipped off her coat and skirt and blouse , and stood doing her hair before the glass , a massive homely figure , her petticoat being so short that she stood on a pair of thick slate-grey legs .
She put one hand upon Rachel 's shoulder , and stooping , picked up a pair of walking-shoes with the other , and placed them neatly side by side outside her door .
As they walked down the passage they passed many pairs of boots and shoes , some black and some brown , all side by side , and all different , even to the way in which they lay together .
Mrs. Paley did not hear .
She repeated it a third time .
Mrs. Paley heard , but she did not understand .
Rachel sat down , as if to study the French newspaper , but a tear fell on the blurred French print , raising a soft blot .
She lifted her head sharply , exclaiming aloud , `` It 's intolerable ! ''
She had now reached one of those eminences , the result of some crisis , from which the world is finally displayed in its true proportions .
For the time , her own body was the source of all the life in the world , which tried to burst forth here -- there -- and was repressed now by Mr. Bax , now by Evelyn , now by the imposition of ponderous stupidity , the weight of the entire world .
Thus tormented , she would twist her hands together , for all things were wrong , all people stupid .
Vaguely seeing that there were people down in the garden beneath she represented them as aimless masses of matter , floating hither and thither , without aim except to impede her .
But even at a distance it could be seen that Mrs. Flushing , upright and imperious , dominated the party .
`` It seems to me bad -- that 's all , '' Rachel replied .
When they all stood upon its deck they found that it was a very small boat which throbbed gently beneath them for a few minutes , and then shoved smoothly through the water .
Mattresses were thrown down , rugs provided , and the three women lay near each other in the soft open air .
It echoed like a hall .
There were sudden cries ; and then long spaces of silence , such as there are in a cathedral when a boy 's voice has ceased and the echo of it still seems to haunt about the remote places of the roof .
`` That is what I have felt ever since I knew you , '' he replied .
`` Very happy , '' she answered .
They continued to walk for some time in silence .
Their steps unconsciously quickened .
Then Rachel exclaimed suddenly , `` Helen ! ''
Rachel had balanced herself near Helen on the end of the tree trunk .
Their eyes , concentrated upon the bank , were full of the same green reflections , and their lips were slightly pressed together as though the sights they were passing gave rise to thoughts , save that Hirst 's lips moved intermittently as half consciously he sought rhymes for God .
They had grown so accustomed to the wall of trees on either side that they looked up with a start when the light suddenly widened out and the trees came to an end .
`` It might be Arundel or Windsor , '' Mr. Flushing continued , `` if you cut down that bush with the yellow flowers ; and , by Jove , look ! ''
She 's behind us . ''
Helen had a beautiful voice .
The darkness fell , but rose again , and as each day spread widely over the earth and parted them from the strange day in the forest when they had been forced to tell each other what they wanted , this wish of theirs was revealed to other people , and in the process became slightly strange to themselves .
Read poetry , Rachel , poetry , poetry , poetry ! ''
`` No , '' she repeated , `` I never fell in love , if falling in love is what people say it is , and it 's the world that tells the lies and I tell the truth .
As if some apology were due to Hirst for the kiss which she then bestowed upon him , Terence protested :
`` We 've only got twenty-one whole mornings left , '' said Rachel .
Terence , meanwhile , read a novel which some one else had written , a process which he found essential to the composition of his own .
She was struck by it herself , for she stopped writing and looked up ; looked at Terence deep in the arm-chair , looked at the different pieces of furniture , at her bed in the corner , at the window-pane which showed the branches of a tree filled in with sky , heard the clock ticking , and was amazed at the gulf which lay between all that and her sheet of paper .
Would there ever be a time when the world was one and indivisible ?
Even with Terence himself -- how far apart they could be , how little she knew what was passing in his brain now !
Choosing `` affectionately , '' after some further speculation , rather than sincerely , she signed the letter and was doggedly beginning on another when Terence remarked , quoting from his book :
Nor were people so solitary and uncommunicative as she believed .
The words did more to unite them than any amount of argument .
They knew that they could not separate ; painful and terrible it might be , but they were joined for ever .
He imitated Evelyn 's enthusiastic tone as she confronted him in the smoking-room .
It 'll be interesting to see what she makes of it . ''
`` Terence says we must go to tea with Mrs. Thornbury because she 's been so kind , but I do n't see it ; in fact , I 'd rather have my right hand sawn in pieces -- just imagine !
They reached the hotel rather early in the afternoon , so that most people were still lying down , or sitting speechless in their bedrooms , and Mrs. Thornbury , although she had asked them to tea , was nowhere to be seen .
`` And they remain women , '' Mrs. Thornbury added .
`` It must be very wonderful to be twenty-five , and not merely to imagine that you 're twenty-five , '' she said , looking from one to the other with her smooth , bright glance .
Twice every day he went in to sit with Rachel , and twice every day the same thing happened .
She did not look very ill .
Sitting by her side he would tell her what he had been doing , using his natural voice to speak to her , only a few tones lower down than usual ; but by the time he had sat there for five minutes he was plunged into the deepest gloom .
She was not the same ; he could not bring them back to their old relationship ; but although he knew that it was foolish he could not prevent himself from endeavouring to bring her back , to make her remember , and when this failed he was in despair .
The strain of listening and the effort of making practical arrangements and seeing that things worked smoothly , absorbed all Terence 's power .
Sunday was rather worse than Saturday had been , simply because the strain was a little greater every day , although nothing else had changed .
The vision of Rachel as she was now , confused and heedless , had almost obliterated the vision of her as she had been once long ago ; he could hardly believe that they had ever been happy , or engaged to be married , for what were feelings , what was there to be felt ?
He was determined to see for himself what kind of man he was .
His confidence in the man vanished as he looked at him and saw his insignificance , his dirty appearance , his shiftiness , and his unintelligent , hairy face .
We shall have rain to-morrow . ''
As he saw the passage outside the room , and the table with the cups and the plates , it suddenly came over him that here was a world in which he would never see Rachel again .
Together they drew into the hollow of a window , and stood there in silence .
Broken words formed themselves at last among Evelyn 's sobs .
`` It was wicked , '' she sobbed , `` it was cruel -- they were so happy . ''
She was like a wounded animal .
She refused to relinquish her friends to death .
She began to pace up and down , clenching her hands , and making no attempt to stop the quick tears which raced down her cheeks .
But Mr. Perrott paid no attention to the steamer or to the weather .
`` Let 's sit down and talk it over , '' she said rather unsteadily .
And I forget ; it can not seem the miracle to you that it does to me .
Now that I know you , all that has changed .
asked Mrs. Flushing , turning to her for the first time with keen interest .
Mrs. Flushing suddenly exclaimed .
