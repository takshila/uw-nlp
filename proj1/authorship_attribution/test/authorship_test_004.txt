Mark impishly and anonymously -- submitted 1601 ; and that same editor , a praiser of Rabelais , scathingly abused it and the sender .
For many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880 , its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed .
Reedy's opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great humorists ; one half suspects that Reedy was thinking of Field 's French Crisis .
But Twain first claimed his bantling from the fog of anonymity in 1906 , in a letter addressed to Mr. Charles Orr , librarian of Case Library , Cleveland .
Said Clemens , in the course of his letter , dated July 30 , 1906 , from Dublin , New Hampshire : `` The title of the piece is 1601 .
The piece is a supposititious conversation which takes place in Queen Elizabeth 's closet in that year , between the Queen , Ben Jonson , Beaumont , Sir Walter Raleigh , the Duchess of Bilgewater , and one or two others , and is not , as John Hay mistakenly supposes , a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste Elizabeth 's time ; if there is a decent word findable in it , it is because I overlooked it .
Here Mrs. Clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations , the children romped over the countryside , and Mark retired to his octagonal study , which , perched high on the hill , looked out upon the valley below .
The 'conversation' recorded by a supposed Pepys of that period , was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day , when fireside sociabilities were limited only to the loosened fancy , vocabulary , and physical performance , and not by any bounds of convention . ''
Joseph Twichell , who , unlike Howells , had no scruples about Mark's 'Elizabethan breadth of parlance . '
Joseph Twichell , Mark 's most intimate friend for over forty years , was pastor of the Asylum Hill Congregational Church of Hartford , which Mark facetiously called the `` Church of the Holy Speculators , '' because of its wealthy parishioners .
Here Mark had first met `` Joe '' at a social , and their meeting ripened into a glorious , life long friendship .
It is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written , for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which 1601 was written , or the keen enjoyment which Mark and `` Joe '' derived from it .
`` SAVE ME ONE . ''
Hay pronounced the sketch a masterpiece , and wrote immediately to his old Cleveland friend , Alexander Gunn , prince of connoisseurs in art and literature .
June 24 , 1880 My dear Gunn : Here it is .
The Globe has not yet recovered from Downey 's inroad , and they wo n't touch it .
Please send back the document as soon as you can , and if , in spite of my prohibition , you take these proofs , save me one .
In ye heat of ye talk it befel yt one did breake wind , yielding an exceding mightie and distresfull stink , whereat all did laugh full sore , and then --
That certain types of English society have not changed materially in their freedom toward breaking wind in public can be noticed in some comparatively recent literature .
Concerning Messalina , there appears to be no question but that she was a nymphomaniac , and that , while Empress of Rome , she participated in some fearful debaucheries .
They returned to America in November , and Clemens hurried back to London alone to deliver a notable series of lectures under the management of George Dolby , formerly managing agent for Charles Dickens .
No letters have been preserved from that time , except two that were sent to a Keokuk weekly , the Saturday Post , and as these were written for publication , and are rather a poor attempt at burlesque humor -- their chief feature being a pretended illiteracy -- they would seem to bear no relation to this collection .
A large amount of provisions and ammunition , which they left behind them , fell into the hands of the Indians .
The California troops went back home , and Noble remained , to help drive the stock over here .
And , as Cousin Sally Dillard says , this is all I know about the fight .
The story as told in that book is an account of what might have happened , rather than history .
Clemens was even more frightened at the prospect of this lecture than he had been in San Francisco , and with more reason , for in New York his friends were not many , and competition for public favor was very great .
There are two letters written May 1st , one to his people , and one to Bret Harte , in San Francisco ; that give us the situation .
We chase phantoms half the days of our lives .
I shall write to please myself , then .
I hope you will set type till you complete that invention , for surely government pap must be nauseating food for a man -- a man whom God has enabled to saw wood and be independent .
Undoubtedly he rejoiced in the brief periods when he was actually before his audience and could play upon it with his master touch , but the dreary intermissions of travel and broken sleep were too heavy a price to pay .
Tell Harmony ( Mrs. T. ) that I do hold the baby , and do it pretty handily , too , although with occasional apprehensions that his loose head will fall off .
I do n't have to quiet him -- he hardly ever utters a cry .
We shall take up our residence in Hartford 6 days from now
To James Redpath , in Boston :
And I mean to keep that fresh all the time .
Of one such visit Howells wrote :
The trouble was , that I was only bent on `` working up an atmosphere '' and that is to me a most fidgety and irksome thing , sometimes .
I have been sick a-bed several days , for the first time in 21 years .
I try not to look back upon these 21 years with a feeling of resentment , and yet the partialities of Providence do seem to me to be slathered around ( as one may say ) without that gravity and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would seem to suggest .
Mrs. Clemens has returned from New York with dreadful sore throat , and bones racked with rheumatism .
as the Kanakas say .
The farce is wonderfully bright and delicious , and must make a hit .
So it would be worth going a long way to see it well played ; for without any question an actor of genius always adds a subtle something to any man 's work that none but the writer knew was there before .
I have heard of readers convulsing audiences with my `` Aurelia 's Unfortunate Young Man . ''
Do not let this generous proposition disturb your rest -- but do write the other 3 acts , and then it will be valuable to managers .
She reads in two hours and 20 minutes and will play not longer than 2 3/4 hours .
Theodore Crane arrived a little later .
Twenty-eight days ago it was his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion , the preface to which he had already written .
We propose to leave here for New York Oct. 21 , reaching Hartford 24th or 25th .
If , upon reflection , you Howellses find , you can stop over here on your way , I wish you would do it , and telegraph me .
Bother it all , I wanted to astonish you with a chapter or two from Orion 's latest book -- not the seventeen which he has begun in the last four months , but the one which he began last week .
It has been a moving time .
I spent my nights with John and Helen Garth , three miles from town , in their spacious and beautiful house .
Now they have a daughter 19 or 20 years old .
He married a young lady whom I knew .
Lieutenant Hickman , the spruce young handsomely-uniformed volunteer of 1846 , called on me -- a grisly elephantine patriarch of 65 now , his grace all vanished .
SAMUEL L. CLEMENS , ESQ .
MY DEAR SIR , -- I take my earliest opportunity to answer your favor of Feb. B -- -- was premature in calling me a `` shrewd man . ''
I was n't one at that time , but am one now -- that is , I am at least too shrewd to ever again invest in anything put on the market by B -- -- .
I think you should have asked somebody else whether I was a shrewd man or not for two reasons : the stock was advertised in a religious paper , a circumstance which was very suspicious ; and the compliment came to you from a man who was interested to make a purchaser of you .
I am afraid you deserve your loss .
ELMIRA , July 27 .
Have n't you had reviewers talk Alps to you , and then print potato hills ?
You tilt the tube skyward and bring planets and comets and corona flames a hundred and fifty thousand miles high into the field .
Which I see you have done , and found Tolstoi .
All alone I managed to inflict agonies on Mrs. Clemens , whereas I was expecting nothing but praises .
Help me , Mr. Lang ; no voice can reach further than yours in a case of this kind , or carry greater weight of authority .
The situation in 1893 was about as here outlined .
The letters to Hall of that year are frequent and carry along the story .
The amount of matter is but 3,000 words short of the American Claimant , for which the syndicate paid $ 12,500 .
There was nothing new in that story , but the finger-prints in this one is virgin ground -- absolutely fresh , and mighty curious and interesting to everybody .
Stanford White came along presently and invited me to go to the World-Champion 's dressing room , which I was very glad to do .
Everywhere he was welcomed by great audiences , and everywhere lavishly entertained .
DEAR JOE , -- The Sages Prof. Fiske and Brander Matthews were out here to tea a week ago and it was a breath of American air to see them .
We have the daily lake-swim ; and all the tribe , servants included ( but not I ) do a good deal of boating ; sometimes with the guide , sometimes without him -- Jean and Clara are competent with the oars .
It can hardly happen -- to the extent of fifty words except in the case of a child : its memory-tablet is not lumbered with impressions , and the actual language can have graving-room there , and preserve the language a year or two , but a grown person 's memory-tablet is a palimpsest , with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a phrase .
No doubt we are constantly littering our literature with disconnected sentences borrowed from books at some unremembered time and now imagined to be our own , but that is about the most we can do .
A year and a half later I stole his dictation , without knowing it , and used it to dedicate my `` Innocents Abroad '' with .
As per Order 78 and the appropriation of the Indian trust funds .
Am I finding fault with you and the rest of the populace ?
For I know the human race 's limitations , and this makes it my duty -- my pleasant duty -- to be fair to it .
Outside of that , as I look at it , there is no obligation upon him .
Oct. 7 , 1906 .
21 FIFTH AVENUE , Jan. 24 , '06 .
After `` After the Wedding '' I read `` The Mother '' aloud and sounded its human deeps with your deep-sea lead .
You ought not to say sarcastic things about my `` fighting on the other side . ''
He bracketed me with Zenophon -- it is there in his Memoirs for anybody to read .
DEAR HENNIKER-HEATON , -- I do hope you will succeed to your heart 's desire in your cheap-cablegram campaign , and I feel sure you will .
He had always loved them , since his first trip there with Twichell thirty-three years earlier , and at `` Bay House , '' the residence of Vice-Consul Allen , where he was always a welcome guest , he could have the attentions and care and comforts of a home .
`` Last night ; but I was asleep before you came , you were out so late ; and when I came to breakfast Miss Gwendolen -- well , she knocked everything out of me , you know -- ''
`` Wonderful girl , wonderful ; her great origin is detectable in her step , her carriage , her features -- but what does he say ?
So he laid them with their majestic kin in the Cholmondeley church , with imposing state and ceremony , and added the supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself .
But he drew the line at hatchments .
`` Den it was you , Marse Washington .
And all burnt out , of course . ''
I guess I hear them coming , now .
`` Well , it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited in this unfortunate way . ''
`` O , magnificently . ''
That 's disposed of .
Everything in its turn .
`` One could quite properly call it devilish in another man , but not in the Senator .
I do not suppose that any other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor , combined with the ability to totally conceal it .
I may except George Washington and Cromwell , and perhaps Robespierre , but I draw the line there .
A person not an expert might be in Judge Hawkins 's company a lifetime and never find out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery . ''
He did n't know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a mistake , he merely knew it ; and knew it for dead certain , too .
And so he bade goodnight , and went mooning out , wondering what he could have done that changed the atmosphere that way .
And the instant it closed they flung their arms about each other 's necks , and there , heart to heart and lip to lip --
That would have made him commonplace .
After breakfast , at some station whose name I have forgotten , we three climbed up on the seat behind the driver , and let the conductor have our bed for a nap .
Overland drivers and conductors used to sit in their places and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time , on good roads , while spinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour .
I saw them do it , often .
It is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature , is the `` sage-brush . ''
It smells like our domestic sage , and `` sage-tea '' made from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well acquainted with .
-- The sage-bushes grow from three to six or seven feet apart , all over the mountains and deserts of the Far West , clear to the borders of California .
Its trunk is as large as a boy 's wrist ( and from that up to a man 's arm ) , and its crooked branches are half as large as its trunk -- all good , sound , hard wood , very like oak .
I unwound the lariat , and fastened one end of it to the limb .
It reached down twenty-two feet -- half way to the ground .
I watched the bull , now , with anxiety -- anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a situation and felt that at any moment death might come .
Presently a thought came into the bull 's eye .
Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do !
No matter what time of the day or night his watch came on , and no matter whether it was winter or summer , raining , snowing , hailing , or sleeting , or whether his `` beat '' was a level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices , or whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with hostile Indians , he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like the wind !
There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty .
He rode fifty miles without stopping , by daylight , moonlight , starlight , or through the blackness of darkness -- just as it happened .
He rode a splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman ; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles , and then , as he came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a fresh , impatient steed , the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in the twinkling of an eye , and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look .
Both rider and horse went `` flying light . ''
It was the very paradise of outlaws and desperadoes .
Violence was the rule .
Force was the only recognized authority .
I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a given time , and this disaster looked very much like ruin .
My confidence left me .
There was no use in making new contracts -- that was plain .
They all sympathized with me , first rate , but they did not know how to help me .
-- these small fry can not do you any good . '
He examined all the papers in detail , and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch , either in the papers or my statement , he would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result .
Ten miles out of Ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to die .
Hunger and fatigue had conquered him .
It would have been inhuman to leave him there .
When the legislature meets I will have the necessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged . ''
What do you think of the country ? ''
Towards sunset about twenty hay-wagons arrived and camped around the house and all the teamsters came in to supper -- a very , very rough set .
We were like the profane man who could not `` do the subject justice , '' the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow .
I do n't mind getting the report and sitting around with the boys a little , while you copy it , if you 're willing to drop down to the principal 's with me . ''
He was full of wonders of the old world , and advised everybody to travel .
He said a man never imagined what surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled .
`` Obs'quies is good .
We are going to get the thing up regardless , you know .
We 've got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind , in No .
He war n't a Catholic .
If anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back that forty-six dollars to the banker ( for I did not expect it of the Prodigal , and was not disappointed ) , I would have felt injured .
Mind , I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs , for it did not , in even the slightest degree .
He then shaved , and put on a clean shirt ; after which he recited the Lord 's Prayer in a fervent , thundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all conversation in the main cabin .
Then , at this stage , being invariably `` by the head , '' or `` by the stern , '' or `` listed to port or starboard , '' he took one more to `` put him on an even keel so that he would mind his hellum and not miss stays and go about , every time he came up in the wind . ''
But these details were only secondary matters -- his face was the lodestone that chained the eye .
It was a sultry disk , glowing determinedly out through a weather beaten mask of mahogany , and studded with warts , seamed with scars , `` blazed '' all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor ; and with cheery eyes , under shaggy brows , contemplating the world from over the back of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out of the undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations .
Mechanics ' Benefit Union .
The Prince of Hawaii 's Own ( Military Company ) .
Servants of Her late Royal Highness .
Bishop of Arathea , Vicar-Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands .
The Clergy of the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church .
His Lordship the Right Rev .
His Excellency the Minister Resident of the United States .

His Highness Prince William , in a showy military uniform ( the `` true prince , '' this -- scion of the house over-thrown by the present dynasty -- he was formerly betrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to marry her ) , stood guard and paced back and forth within the door .
If you obtain one man before the corpse is removed , one will be sufficient ; but after it leaves this house four will be required .
If delayed until we carry the corpse to the grave there must be ten ; but after it is deposited in the grave there must be fifteen .
Then I recognized the charity and the friendliness in the faces before me , and little by little my fright melted away , and I began to talk Within three or four minutes I was comfortable , and even content .
My three chief allies , with three auxiliaries , were on hand , in the parquette , all sitting together , all armed with bludgeons , and all ready to make an onslaught upon the feeblest joke that might show its head .
[ I do not desire to strain the reader 's fancy , hurtfully , and yet it would be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle , or the duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee -- M. T. : ]
Then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds , and stamped on them , and broke several things with his cane , and said I did not know as much as a cow ; and then went out and banged the door after him , and , in short , acted in such a way that I fancied he was displeased about something .
But not knowing what the trouble was , I could not be any help to him .
I wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total , otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness , and of course I could n't do it .
Neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement , but I had to stick to my point .
And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop 's road three days each -- gratis ; every head of a family , and every son of a family , three days each , gratis , and a day or so added for their servants .
The farmers were bound to throw in something , to sort of offset my liberality , whether I would or no ; so I let them give me a flint and steel ; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy and me on our horse , I lit my pipe .
When the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet , all those people broke for the woods , and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud .
I had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance .
And I promised , with my hand on my heart , that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead .
`` Where do they hang out ? ''
`` Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine .
And so they came to an abbey of monks , and there were well lodged .
And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree , and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it , and some threw mire upon the shield -- ''
I mean would be a step toward that .
At the head of the hall , on a dais , was the table of the king , queen , and their son , Prince Uwaine .
Stretching down the hall from this , was the general table , on the floor .
In a gallery a band with cymbals , horns , harps , and other horrors , opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as `` In the Sweet Bye and Bye . ''
For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged , after dinner .
On his wrists and ankles were cicatrices , old smooth scars , and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached ; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground , and was thick with rust .
Chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner .
And behold , His anger was in that moment appeased , and the waters gushed richly forth again , and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure . ''
He strained her to his breast , and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses , and washed them with the rain of his tears .
And the husband and father , with his wife and child gone , never to be seen by him again in life ?
When I saw him that first time -- however , his personal condition will not quite bear description here .
You can read it in the Lives of the Saints .
It was a great night , an immense night .
I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it .
`` This will bring them here -- when ? ''
I found the water some three hundred yards away , and had been resting about twenty minutes , when I heard voices .
But the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road -- smartly clad people of quality , with luggage-mules and servants in their train !
But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders ; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness .
`` Ah , I know that sign : thou'st a wife at home , poor soul , and you and she have gone hungry to bed , many 's the time , that the little ones might have your crust ; you know what poverty is , and the daily insults of your betters , and the heavy hand of the Church and the king . ''
Matters were serious now .
The peasant toiled his difficult way up .
The king raised himself up and stood ; he made a leg ready , and when the comer 's head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud , and down went the man floundering to the ground .
He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night , for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country-side .
I struck the ground an instant after him ; we sprang to our appointed places , and began to give and take with all our might .
Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd , and a voice shouted :
I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened , whenever I might choose .
I was far from expecting ever to belong to him , for the price asked for me from the time I was first enslaved was exorbitant , and always provoked either anger or derision , yet my master stuck stubbornly to it -- twenty-two dollars .
He would n't bate a cent .
There were three of them .
He had disappointed me twice , because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe ; but this time I succeeded ; I captured the lower clasp of the three , and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way .
Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramor , an imposing tower of iron , stately and rigid , his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand , his grand horse 's face and breast cased in steel , his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the ground -- oh , a most noble picture .
shouted a score of knights .
`` The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter ; they make twelve independent fences , ten feet apart -- that is to say , twelve circles within circles -- and their ends come into the cave again . ''
In Merlin 's Cave -- Clarence and I and fifty-two fresh , bright , well-educated , clean-minded young British boys .
At dawn I sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance , as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines , `` _and no telling at what moment -- therefore , vacate at once_ . ''
These people knew me , and had confidence in my word .
They would clear out without waiting to part their hair , and I could take my own time about dating the explosion .
You could n't hire one of them to go back during the century , if the explosion was still impending .
`` Turn on the water ! ''
He said , `` Sid , Sid ! ''
So at last , with a sigh and a yawn , he gave it up .
It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come .
The air was utterly dead .
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees .
Tom's heart ached to be free , or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time .
Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out .
They ai n't going to hurt us .
`` Steady , steady-y-y-y ! ''
It was getting so lonesome anyway , and now it 'll be worse .
`` I do n't think I said anything , '' said Sid .
`` I do n't like to stir 'em up , either .
S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something ! ''
The two men got out some food and made a luncheon .
YOU 'RE a watchman , ai n't you !
A call came from a window :
Do n't you remember you was to watch there that night ? ''
He held his candle aloft and said :
I was greatly interested in the incident of Eve and the serpent , and thought Eve 's calmness was perfectly noble .
Of the first eighteen years of his life _nothing_ is known .
No young man could have been at work in an attorney 's office without being called upon continually to act as a witness , and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name . ''
There is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of Shakespeare , even by rumor or tradition , which supports this notion of a clerkship .
Is this man to live for ever ?
Is the prince to tarry uninstalled , because , forsooth , the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours ?
Slippered , and wrapped in a sumptuous robe , he laid himself down at last to rest , but not to sleep , for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people .
He could not dismiss the former , so they stayed ; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter , so they stayed also , to his vast regret -- and theirs .
He also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation , and then be hanged , drawn and quartered , according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason .
`` 'She loved her husband dearilee , But another man -- '
`` They are for thee !
-- all of them , every one !
The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal , and was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it .
The King entered , and paused .
The hermit turned a pair of gleaming , unrestful eyes upon him , and said --
There 's awe in your face !
I go thither and return , in the twinkling of an eye .
for I was greater than they .
Touch my hand -- be not afraid -- touch it .
He paused , to give this speech effect ; then his face suddenly changed , and he started to his feet again saying , with angry energy , `` Yes , I am an archangel ; A MERE ARCHANGEL !
It is verily true .
I was told it from heaven in a dream , twenty years ago ; ah , yes , I was to be pope !
`` O good sir , peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried here the night .
He will be back anon . ''
They shook their heads ; then the master said --
Three years past , he had written a pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor , accusing him of injustice , and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory , and degradation from the bar , and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life .
Lately he had repeated his offence ; and in consequence was now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS , pay a fine of 5,000 pounds , be branded on both cheeks , and remain in prison for life .
, issuing from a red and white rose , with the effigy of the new King 's mother , Jane Seymour , represented by his side .
`` Sir Thomas , arrest this -- No , hold ! ''
It was a lucky thought , a happy thought .
That it was so considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances .
How surprised they were , then , to see nothing of the sort happen -- how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly , in a confident and untroubled voice , and say --
`` Then how used you it ? ''
Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about .
It had kept that reputation unsmirched during three generations , and was prouder of it than of any other of its possessions .
It was so proud of it , and so anxious to insure its perpetuation , that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to its babies in the cradle , and made the like teachings the staple of their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education .
But at last , in the drift of time , Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend a passing stranger -- possibly without knowing it , certainly without caring , for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself , and cared not a rap for strangers or their opinions .
He contrived many plans , and all of them were good , but none of them was quite sweeping enough : the poorest of them would hurt a great many individuals , but what he wanted was a plan which would comprehend the entire town , and not let so much as one person escape unhurt .
Can I see your husband a moment , madam ? ''
No , he was gone to Brixton , and might not return before morning .
I merely wanted to leave that sack in his care , to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be found .
Good-night , madam . ''
The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger , and was glad to see him go .
Two great kindnesses in fact .
I was a ruined gambler .
I begged of the right man .
It is merely my way of testifying my gratitude to him .
Tell the contents of this present writing to any one who is likely to be the right man .
If the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it , give him the money , and ask no further questions , for he is certainly the right man .
`` But if you shall prefer a public inquiry , then publish this present writing in the local paper -- with these instructions added , to wit : Thirty days from now , let the candidate appear at the town-hall at eight in the evening ( Friday ) , and hand his remark , in a sealed envelope , to the Rev .
-- for we are so poor , so old and poor !
... '' Then , with a sigh -- '' But it was not my Edward ; no , it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars .
It is a pity too ; I see it now ... . ''
the wages of sin ; we could n't take it ; we could n't touch it .
At eleven Mr. Richards arrived , and while his wife was saying `` I am SO glad you 've come ! ''
he was saying , `` I am so tired -- tired clear out ; it is dreadful to be poor , and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of life .
Do n't mind my talk -- it 's just a moment 's irritation and does n't mean anything .
What 's in the sack ? ''
Why , Mary , it 's for-ty thousand dollars -- think of it -- a whole fortune !
Not ten men in this village are worth that much .
He tapped his old wife on the cheek , and said humorously , `` Why , we 're rich , Mary , rich ; all we've got to do is to bury the money and burn the papers .
If the gambler ever comes to inquire , we 'll merely look coldly upon him and say : 'What is this nonsense you are talking ?
We have never heard of you and your sack of gold before ; ' and then he would look foolish , and -- '' `` And in the meantime , while you are running on with your jokes , the money is still here , and it is fast getting along toward burglar-time . ''
Very well , what shall we do -- make the inquiry private ?
No , not that ; it would spoil the romance .
The public method is better .
It 's a great card for us .
`` Not a soul -- on honour , not a soul ! ''
She broke down , crying .
The house was stupefied .
Lawyer Wilson spoke up now , and said :
The pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a sort to make the judicious weep .
Those whose withers were unwrung laughed till the tears ran down ; the reporters , in throes of laughter , set down disordered pot-hooks which would never in the world be decipherable ; and a sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits , and barked itself crazy at the turmoil .
All manner of cries were scattered through the din : `` We 're getting rich -- TWO Symbols of Incorruptibility !
-- count Shadbelly in -- we ca n't have too many ! ''
`` All right -- Billson 's elected ! ''
Edward fell -- that is , he sat still ; sat with a conscience which was not satisfied , but which was overpowered by circumstances .
He was running for the Legislature on one ticket , and Pinkerton on the other .
It was a close race and a hot one , and getting hotter every day .
Both had strong appetites for money ; each had bought a great tract of land , with a purpose ; there was going to be a new railway , and each wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the route to his own advantage ; a single vote might make the decision , and with it two or three fortunes .
Of course , they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies , just like anybody ; but they do n't notice it until their attention is called to it .
They have got me so that sometimes I never tell a verbal lie now except in a modified form ; and even in the modified form they do n't approve of it .
Still , that is as far as I can go in the interest of the growing friendly relations between the two countries ; I must keep some of my self-respect -- and my health .
'Why do n't they ? '
I thought I should find that miserable thing in one little moment ; and I set about that matter with such confidence that those people grew grace , beginning to suspect that perhaps they had been too hasty .
'She said you would have these delusions , but must pay no attention to them .
The Christian-Scientist engineer drives exactly the same trade as the other engineers , yet he out-prospers the whole of them put together .

For hours we talked over the great plan , without ever feeling hungry ; and at last , when all the details had been arranged satisfactorily , we cast lots and Millet was elected -- elected to die , as we called it .
( Diary entry ) May 4 .
None seen , however , this forenoon , so we have determined to go together north and a little west to some islands in 18 degrees or 19 degrees north latitude and 114 degrees to 115 degrees west longitude , hoping in the meantime to be picked up by some ship .
No breeze -- the longed-for trades still missing .
'Then , as I understand it , your scheme is -- '
It has never intruded into business ; and Jewish persecution is not a religious passion , it is a business passion .
'That may be ; yes , that may be ; still , I have put the money in it , and am content .
The railway officials -- as the public think and as you also seem to think -- are not aware that there are any insults except spoken ones .
So nobody goes to headquarters and reports insults of manner , insults of gesture , look , and so forth ; and yet these are sometimes harder to bear than any words .
They are bitter hard to bear because there is nothing tangible to take hold of ; and the insulter can always say , if called before the railway officials , that he never dreamed of intending any offence .
It seems to me that the officials ought to specially and urgently request the public to report unworded affronts and incivilities . '
When a young girl reaches eighteen she is recognised as being a woman .
She adds six inches to her skirt , she unplaits her dangling braids and balls her hair on top of her head , she stops sleeping with her little sister and has a room to herself , and becomes in many ways a thundering expense .
There is no avoiding it .
The Great Republic lengthened her skirts last year , balled up her hair , and entered the world 's society .
This means that , if she would prosper and stand fair with society , she must put aside some of her dearest and darlingest young ways and superstitions , and do as society does .
She is in Rome ; and it has long been granted that when one is in Rome it is good policy to do as Rome does .
Dr. Lecher is still peacefully speaking , the stenographers listening at his lips . )
He attended enough longtimes , reflecting all solely .
Finally he trapped ( attrape ) a frog , him carried to that individual , and said :
The law of probabilities decreed me guiltless of his blood ; for in all my small experience with guns I had never hit anything I had tried to hit , and I knew I had done my best to hit him .
Yet there was no solace in the thought .
And then when they Were nothing fearing , and God 's peace was in the air , And none was prophesying harm , The vast disaster fell : Where stood the temple when the sun went down Was vacant desert when it rose again !
Then they discussed optics , as they called it , and whether a certain injury to the brain would produce blindness or not , but they could not agree about it , and said they must test it by experiment by and by ; and next they discussed plants , and that interested me , because in the summer Sadie and I had planted seeds -- I helped her dig the holes , you know -- and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there , and it was a wonder how that could happen ; but it did , and I wished I could talk -- I would have told those people about it and shown then how much I knew , and been all alive with the subject ; but I did n't care for the optics ; it was dull , and when they came back to it again it bored me , and I went to sleep .
`` Well , I declare !
What did he want with that ? ''
`` Well , I got my boots on , and we went down and slipped in and laid the paper of sugar on the berth , and sat down soft and sheepish and went to listening to Bud Dixon snore .
It laid over by the bulkhead , and was nearly the color of the carpet .
`` I never said anything about being glad ; I only -- ''
Some rushed off to spread the news and tell the justice of the peace and have an inquest , and me and Tom lit out for the house .
WELL , that was a hard month on us all .
It was the same up at the jail .
but it never made any difference -- it was murder , and he would n't have it any other way .

It was right under our noses all the time , and we did n't see it . ''
It 's just a photograft , that 's what it is . ''
Yes , sir , and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual . ''
We started on a run .
The others were privileged to feel as they chose , but in my heart 's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time ; for I had small desire that Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds , as you can easily believe .
Also , in my department will always be found elaborate condensations of the Patent Office Reports , wherein a faithful endeavour will at all times be made to strip the nutritious facts bare of that effulgence of imagination and sublimity of diction which too often mar the excellence of those great works .
Forninst this fact it would be sagacious if the divil wint the rounds of his establishment to prepare for the occasion , and tuk the precaution to warrum up the Prussian depairtment a bit agin the day .
What a weird sensation it is to feel the stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under you and see the bow climbing high away among the clouds !
One 's safest course that day was to clasp a railing and hang on ; walking was too precarious a pastime .
We sailed along the shore of the island of Pico , under a stately green pyramid that rose up with one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7,613 feet , and thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a fog !
The silence of the boys annoyed me .
And their dresses are strange beyond all description .
-- I thought he was the Emperor at least .
The reason is that Spain sends her heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims , while America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a gunboat occasionally .
The Moors have a small opinion of England , France , and America , and put their representatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution before they grant them their common rights , let alone a favor .
He has rebuilt Paris and has partly rebuilt every city in the state .
He condemns a whole street at a time , assesses the damages , pays them , and rebuilds superbly .
Then speculators buy up the ground and sell , but the original owner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price before the speculator is permitted to purchase .
I wish I had my immortelles back , now , and that bunch of radishes .
Well provided with cigars and other necessaries of life , we are now ready to take the cars for Milan .
We adjourned to a cafe and played billiards an hour , and I made six or seven points by the doctor pocketing his ball , and he made as many by my pocketing my ball .
The table was of the usual European style -- cushions dead and twice as high as the balls ; the cues in bad repair .
You would think that those men had an astonishing talent for seeing things that had already passed away .
It suggests no crystal waters , no picturesque shores , no sublimity .
`` Then die ! ''
I am told that the old masters had to do these shameful things for bread , the princes and potentates being the only patrons of art .
I would go to America , and see , and learn , and return to the Campagna and stand before my countrymen an illustrious discoverer .
and made use of various other remarks expressive of derision .

Odessa is about twenty hours ' run from Sebastopol , and is the most northerly port in the Black Sea .
We came here to get coal , principally .
It is a free port , and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world .
It is to be almost inclosed by massive stone piers , one of which will extend into the sea over three thousand feet in a straight line .
We arrived in twenty minutes from the Emperor 's .
In the park are rustic seats , here and there , in secluded nooks that are dark with shade ; there are rivulets of crystal water ; there are lakelets , with inviting , grassy banks ; there are glimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of foliage ; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the trunks of forest trees ; there are miniature marble temples perched upon gray old crags ; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad expanse of landscape and ocean .
At 6 o'clock P.M. , we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a shapely mountain overlooking the sea , and the handsome valley where dwelt some of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much about ; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram , King of Tyre , who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills to build portions of King Solomon 's Temple with .
We have been in a historical section of country all day .
At noon we camped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh , near the junction of the Lebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh , and looked down into the immense , level , garden-like Valley of Lebanon .
To-night we are camping near the same valley , and have a very wide sweep of it in view .
One might swear that all the John Smiths and George Wilkinsons , and all the other pitiful nobodies between Kingdom Come and Baalbec would inscribe their poor little names upon the walls of Baalbec 's magnificent ruins , and would add the town , the county and the State they came from -- and swearing thus , be infallibly correct .
We visited the places where Jesus worked for fifteen years as a carpenter , and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and was driven out by a mob .
Catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protect the little fragments of the ancient walls which remain .
They hastened to preserve the relic .
One 's conscience can never be the worse for the knowledge that he has paid his way like a man .
To speak the strict truth , however , our party seldom offend in that way , though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it .
There is a certain bird called a phoenix .
And when the time of its dissolution draws near , that it must die , it makes itself a nest of frankincense , and myrrh , and other spices , into which , when its time is fulfilled , it enters and dies .
From it , in ancient times , the Jewish High Priest turned loose the scapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away his twelve-month load of the sins of the people .
If they were to turn one loose now , he would not get as far as the Garden of Gethsemane , till these miserable vagabonds here would gobble him up , -- [ Favorite pilgrim expression . ]
-- sins and all .
My second was to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that direction .
I acted on the latter impulse .
Another was going to sit still till the first lance reached within an inch of his breast , and then dodge it and seize it .
I forbear to tell what he was going to do to that Bedouin that owned it .
It makes my blood run cold to think of it .
It would have been worth any price if the father of this hopeful youth could have stepped on board some time , and seen him standing high on the fore-castle , pea jacket , tasseled red fez , buckskin patch and all , placidly contemplating the ocean -- a rare spectacle for any body's drawing-room .
`` Wednesday -- Weather still very savage .
A hawk was blown off , also .
He circled round and round the ship , wanting to light , but afraid of the people .
The steamer Quaker City has accomplished at last her extraordinary voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street .
They will dance a good deal , sing a good deal , make love , but sermonize very little .
Three-fourths of the Quaker City 's passengers were between forty and seventy years of age !
But it was not .
Let us average the ages of the Quaker City 's pilgrims and set the figure down as fifty years .
No doubt it was presumed here at home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all day , and day after day , and kept up a noisy excitement from one end of the ship to the other ; and that they played blind-man 's buff or danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the quarter-deck ; and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted a laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an elaborate plan when they left home , and then skurried off to their whist and euchre labors under the cabin lamps .
If these things were presumed , the presumption was at fault .
The excursionists danced , on three separate evenings , long , long ago , ( it seems an age . )
He had his New York cablegram in his hand -- from the New York _World_ -- and he was so evidently trying to get around that cable with invented softnesses and palliations that my curiosity was aroused and I wanted to see what it did really say .
So when occasion offered I slipped it out of his hand .
How gracious it was that , in that forlorn hour of wreck and ruin , with the night of death closing around her , she should have been granted that beautiful illusion -- that the latest vision which rested upon the clouded mirror of her mind should have been the vision of her mother , and the latest emotion she should know in life the joy and peace of that dear imagined presence .
In form and feature he bears some resemblance to the immortal Nasby ; but whilst Petroleum is brunette to the core , Twain is golden , amber-hued , melting , blonde . ''
After that fourth night , that proud night , that triumphant night , I was the only subject .
Up to that time a dozen wise old heads , the intellectual aristocracy of the town , had held out , as implacable unbelievers .
Human beings feel dishonor the most , sometimes , when they most deserve it .
By the end of the first year he found he must make some economies .
The office rent was cheap , but it was not cheap enough .
It had to be that from the start .
Finally he handed it over to Mr. Johnson , and went up to Muscatine , Iowa , and acquired a small interest in a weekly newspaper there .
It was not a sort of property to marry on -- but no matter .
He came across a winning and pretty girl who lived in Quincy , Illinois , a few miles below Keokuk , and they became engaged .
And now he achieved nothing but misfortune by it , because he straightway fell in love with a Keokuk girl .
He married the Keokuk girl and they began a struggle for life which turned out to be a difficult enterprise , and very unpromising .
He `` held the age , '' as the poker-clergy say , and two ca n't talk at the same time with good effect .
Those scraps which he had put into my hand were ancient newspaper copies of that `` Christian Union '' article !
In truth there is a certain sardonic propriety in preserving our orthography , since ours is a mongrel language which started with a child 's vocabulary of three hundred words , and now consists of two hundred and twenty-five thousand ; the whole lot , with the exception of the original and legitimate three hundred , borrowed , stolen , smouched from every unwatched language under the sun , the spelling of each individual word of the lot locating the source of the theft and preserving the memory of the revered crime .
I have been affronted by a fellow officer , and we fight at three this afternoon .
`` 'They reckon ill who leave me out ; They know not well the subtle ways I keep .

Early in August , Shelley was in London trying to raise money .
he is not close enough yet , it seems --
`` and if he succeeds we shall have an additional motive to induce you to come among us in the summer . ''
In 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings , whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines , honeysuckles , and morning glories .
Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks , marigolds , touch-me-nots , prince's-feathers , and other old-fashioned flowers ; while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame .
When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat , the cat was there -- in sunny weather -- stretched at full length , asleep and blissful , with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose .
All along the streets , on both sides , at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks , stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing , and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrancer in spring , when the clusters of buds came forth .
The main street , one block back from the river , and running parallel with it , was the sole business street .
The candy-striped pole , which indicates nobility proud and ancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice , indicated merely the humble barbershop along the main street of Dawson 's Landing .
On a chief corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots and pans and cups , the chief tinmonger 's noisy notice to the world ( when the wind blew ) that his shop was on hand for business at that corner .
The town was sleepy and comfortable and contented .
It was fifty years old , and was growing slowly -- very slowly , in fact , but still it was growing .
He was very proud of his old Virginian ancestry , and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately manners , he kept up its traditions .
He was respected , esteemed , and beloved by all of the community .
With this pair lived the judge 's widowed sister , Mrs. Rachel Pratt , and she also was childless -- childless , and sorrowful for that reason , and not to be comforted .
They were Presbyterians , the judge was a freethinker .
He was very popular with the people , and was the judge 's dearest friend .
Percy Northumberland Driscoll , brother to the judge , and younger than he by five years , was a married man , and had had children around his hearthstone ; but they were attacked in detail by measles , croup , and scarlet fever , and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective antediluvian methods ; so the cradles were empty .
In that same month of February , Dawson 's Landing gained a new citizen .
But for an unfortunate remark of his , he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at Dawson 's Landing .
He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable , whereupon young Wilson said , much as one who is thinking aloud : `` I wish I owned half of that dog . ''
`` _Is , _ I reckon you better say . ''
`` What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half ?
Do you reckon he thought it would live ? ''
He was a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals ; he was an exceedingly humane man toward the erring of his own race .
He called his servants before him .
There were three of these , besides Roxy : a man , a woman , and a boy twelve years old .
But he did n't .
He discovered nothing ; and she went home jubilant , and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind .
When Tom had had enough , he would slip out and tie knots in Chamber 's shirt , dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo , then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged at the stubborn knots with his teeth .
But that was nothing ; his uncle told him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died ; so Tom was comforted .
and Higgins passes on .
De reason it ai n't enough is 'ca'se Marse Tom gambles . ''
I deserved what I 've got , but be good and let me off with that .
`` What were the reasons ? ''
That he was one himself was far from reconciling him to that despised race .
Everybody was pitying Tom , he looked so quiet and sorrowful , and seemed to feel his great loss so deeply .
He was playing a part , but it was not all a part .
The picture of his alleged uncle , as he had last seen him , was before him in the dark pretty frequently , when he was away , and called again in his dreams , when he was asleep .
He would n't go into the room where the tragedy had happened .
I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by Hannibal when I was a boy , -- an acre or so of white , sweet-smelling boards in each raft , a crew of two dozen men or more , three or four wigwams scattered about the raft 's vast level space for storm-quarters , -- and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of their big crews , the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning successors ; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get on these rafts and have a ride .
They all laughed , and I tried again to talk , but they broke in on me and stopped me .
'Well , you do seem to know something . '
As I have said , the big rise brought a new world under my vision .
Mr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot whose feats of memory were a constant marvel to me .
However , his memory was born in him , I think , not built .
For instance , somebody would mention a name .
'Do you mean to tell me that you wo n't turn a wheel with one of the very best and oldest pilots on the river because he do n't belong to your association ? '
Brown glared at me in unaffected surprise ; and for as much as a moment he was entirely speechless ; then he shouted to me --
Grace and picturesqueness drop gradually out of it as one travels away from New York . '
MY idea was , to tarry a while in every town between St. Louis and New Orleans .
Night fell as we were going out of the 'Upper River ' and meeting the floods of the Ohio .
We dashed along without anxiety ; for the hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream a long distance out of the channel ; or rather , about one county has gone into the river from the Missouri point , and the Cairo point has 'made down ' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly .
LOUIS LE GRAND , ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE , REGNE ; LE NEUVIEME AVRIL , 1682 .
Lamps in such places are of course not wasted ; it is much more convenient and comfortable for a pilot to hold on them than on a spread of formless blackness that won't stay still ; and money is saved to the boat , at the same time , for she can of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can with it squared across her stern and holding her back .
He was obliged to quit the Southern States in consequence .
cried I , 'FIVE hundred would rot his principles , paralyze his industry , drag him to the rumshop , thence to the gutter , thence to the almshouse , thence to -- -- '
Well , now that everything seemed to be arranged satisfactorily to everybody concerned , a new trouble broke out : it transpired that these two men were expecting to share equally in the money with me .
That was not my idea .
I said that if they got half of it between them they might consider themselves lucky .
No , only the first six days .
'Five hundred better . '
The boat was landed in the eddy just above the town , and through the exertions of the citizens the cabin passengers , officers , and part of the crew and deck passengers were taken ashore and removed to the hotels and residences .
'That 's what 's the matter !
It used to be rough times with me when you knew me -- insurance-agency business , you know ; mighty irregular .
But you bet you , this is the business !

The ancient railings are hand-made , and are now comparatively rare and proportionately valuable .

His cook or his butler would have said , 'Like the flag-officer done . '
You hear gentlemen say , 'Where have you been at ? '
The very elect carelessly say 'will ' when they mean 'shall ' ; and many of them say , 'I did n't go to do it , ' meaning 'I did n't mean to do it . '
They say 'reckon . '
One knows the orders combined in this half-breed's architecture without inquiring : one parent Northern , the other Southern .
The shopman always responds ; gives the child a bit of licorice-root , gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of thread , gives the governor -- I do n't know what he gives the governor ; support , likely .
As darkness crept on , there were few on board who did not wish themselves nearer home . '
The young sinners fled forth then , and did a very foolish thing : married themselves before an obscure Justice of the Peace , and got him to antedate the thing .
'Yes , I was .
i want to tell you my thanks for the way you talked to me when i was in prison -- it has led me to try and be a better man ; i guess you thought i did not cair for what you said , & at the first go off I did n't , but i noed you was a man who had don big work with good men & want no sucker , nor want gasing & all the boys knod it .

It was not a time to neglect even trifling precautions .
There was no occasion to add anything to the facilities for attracting notice to me -- so I put the light out .
'A dark and dreadful one ? '
I remember one summer when everybody in town had this disease at once .
These railroads have made havoc with the steamboat commerce .
The clerk of our boat was a steamboat clerk before these roads were built .
'Now , ' said the head , 'place me where I told you . '
And fearfully she obeyed it in all its commands .
Retaining its animation , it looked around the lodge as usual , and it would command its sister to go in such places as it thought would procure for her the flesh of different animals she needed .
So the superior manito decrees , and I must bear all patiently . '
In this situation we must leave the head .

It is indeed as the Sweet Singer of Michigan says -- irrelevantly , of course , for the one and unfailing great quality which distinguishes her poetry from Shakespeare 's and makes it precious to us is its stern and simple irrelevancy :

Some time during the forenoon , approaching the mountains , we changed from the regular train to one composed of little canvas-sheltered cars that skimmed along within a foot of the ground and seemed to be going fifty miles an hour when they were really making about twenty .
Each car had seating capacity for half-a-dozen persons ; and when the curtains were up one was substantially out of doors , and could see everywhere , and get all the breeze , and be luxuriously comfortable .

Ask the Indians , ask the traders , ask the soldiers ; they 'll tell you .
Every morning they go clattering down into the plain , and there she sits on my back with her bugle at her mouth and sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions for an hour or more ; and it is too beautiful for anything to see those ponies dissolve from one formation into another , and waltz about , and break , and scatter , and form again , always moving , always graceful , now trotting , now galloping , and so on , sometimes near by , sometimes in the distance , all just like a state ball , you know , and sometimes she ca n't hold herself any longer , but sounds the 'charge , ' and turns me loose !
She taught it to me , and told me what it says : 'IT IS I , SOLDIER -- COME ! '
and when those thrilling notes come floating down the distance I hear them without fail , even if I am two miles away ; and then -- oh , then you should see my heels get down to business !
`` Well , then , in my belief he is more likely to be dog than poultry .
Look at the mosquito . ''
That 's settled . ''
`` Glad am I , dear !
Now then -- all ready -- sound the advance , and away we go ! ''
Then she blew the 'retreat , ' and said , 'That 's for you , you rebels ; the Rangers do n't ever retreat ! '
Buffalo Bill was in a horse-litter , with his leg broken by a bullet , and Mongrel and Blake Haskins 's horse were doing the work .
Buffalo Bill and Thorndike had lolled both of those toughs .
I know it perfectly well , Marse Tom , and I ai n't saying it by guess . ''
`` Marse Tom , you are just putting on ; you know it perfectly well ; I do n't know what makes you act like that -- but you always did , even when you was little , and you ca n't get over it , I reckon .
There 's no other sport that begins with it .
It was a Sunday afternoon , and beautiful weather , and my uncle , the priest , took me as a reward for being a good boy and because of my own accord and without anybody asking me I had bankrupted my savings-box and given the money to a mission that was civilizing the Chinese and sweetening their lives and softening their hearts with the gentle teachings of our religion , and I wish you could have seen what we saw that day , Thorndike .
Now let the learned look upon this picture and say if iconoclasm can further go :
Him and the individual touched their frogs by behind , and the frog new put to jump smartly , but Daniel himself lifted ponderously , exalted the shoulders thus , like a Frenchman -- to what good ?
But , to speak the plain truth , that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences , and a man is liable to interruption .
`` YOUNG AUTHOR . ''
-- Yes , Agassiz does recommend authors to eat fish , because the phosphorus in it makes brain .
But I can not help you to a decision about the amount you need to eat -- at least , not with certainty .
Not the largest kind , but simply good , middling-sized whales .
Arrived at the henroost ( your neighbor 's , not your own ) , you light a match and hold it under first one and then another pullet 's nose until they are willing to go into that bag without making any trouble about it .
You then return home , either taking the bag with you or leaving it behind , according as circumstances shall dictate .
In San Francisco , the other day , `` A well-dressed boy , on his way to Sunday-school , was arrested and thrown into the city prison for stoning Chinamen . ''
Presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace .
It grew louder ; it spread farther .
It swept the dukedom .
And this is what the whisper said :
Of all the -- come in ! ''
`` Yes -- now she is . ''
They always save up all the old scraps of printed rubbish you throw on the floor , and stack them up carefully on the table , and start the fire with your valuable manuscripts .
They do all the mean things they can think of , and they do them just out of pure cussedness , and nothing else .
It was a sad day for the poor girl when she saw the surgeons reverently bearing away the sack whose uses she had learned by previous experience , and her heart told her the bitter truth that some more of her lover was gone .
Then there was a fine storm !
The nation is lost .
`` I -- I -- that is -- if you do n't mind , would you -- would you say that over again ?
`` The average Christian Scientist has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet .
That means an income for the Trust , in the near future , of -- let us venture to say -- millions more per year .
He was majestically fearless and heroic ; he had the strength of thirty men and the daring of thirty thousand ; handling armies , organizing states , administering governments -- these were pastimes to him ; he publicly and ostentatiously accepted the human race at its own valuation -- as demigods -- and privately and successfully dealt with it at quite another and juster valuation -- as children and slaves ; his ambitions were stupendous , and his dreams had no commerce with the humble plain , but moved with the cloud-rack among the snow-summits .
Upon that one his flow of words was full and free , he was a geyser .

Thus the Sanhedrin is the personal property of Mrs. Eddy .
It is another Board of Shadows .
It will be noticed that in skeletonizing a list of the qualities which have carried her to the dizzy summit which she occupies , I have not mentioned the power which was the commanding force employed in achieving that lofty flight .
Mrs. Eddy has this efficient worship , this massed and centralized force , this force which is indifferent to opposition , untroubled by fear , and goes to battle singing , like Cromwell 's soldiers ; and while she has it she can command and it will obey , and maintain her on her throne , and extend her empire .
All -- every one .
It was exercised for generations afterwards .
If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago it would be difficult to satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now .
Mrs. Eddy has that control -- a control wholly without limit , a control shared with no one .
In simple truth , she is the only absolute sovereign in all Christendom .
And her yoke does not fret , does not offend .
It is not so with this one 's human property ; their loyalty is genuine , earnest , sincere , enthusiastic .
There 's two arms on each shoulder -- ''
Each has an arm on each shoulder .
Of course they do ; especially if they are in a hurry and ca n't stop to think which belongs to which . ''
Why , how you talk !
It 's just grand ! ''
The cravats were as broad as a bankbill , with fringed ends which stood far out to right and left like the wings of a dragon-fly , and this also was strictly in accordance with the fashion of the time .
`` Oh , dear , no ! ''
answered both ladies promptly , `` you can trust us , don't you be afraid . ''
I thought it must be wrong . ''
They were banned creatures , of fearful origin ; they could be dangerous company for the children .
The color went out of his sister Joan 's face .
`` Ah , yes , '' said old Jacques d'Arc , `` things are come to a pretty pass , indeed !
In two months I shall be with the Dauphin . ''
`` My uncle is very good to me , '' Joan said .
It is arranged , and we go at dawn to-morrow .
Domremy was dazed , amazed , stupefied , and said to itself , `` Was this world-wonder in our familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see it ? ''
Jean and Pierre went out from the village , stared at and envied like the great and fortunate of the earth , and their progress to Vaucouleurs was like a triumph , all the country-side flocking to see and salute the brothers of one with whom angels had spoken face to face , and into whose hands by command of God they had delivered the destinies of France .
She said it with that sort of repressed fieriness that means so much when a person 's heart is in a thing .
An odor as of breakfast came stealing through the wood ; the Paladin unconsciously inflated his nostrils in lustful response , and got up and limped painfully away , saying he must go and look to his horse .
They burst suddenly out of the woods , and in considerable force , too ; but we were not the apprentices we were ten or twelve days before ; no , we were seasoned to this kind of adventure now ; our hearts did not jump into our throats and our weapons tremble in our hands .
We were no more dismayed by the sight of those people than our commander was .
Before they could form , Joan had delivered the order , `` Forward ! ''
They stood no chance ; they turned tail and scattered , we plowing through them as if they had been men of straw .
It was fine to see the Paladin 's face light up when she said that .
`` Indeed I did not know it , '' I said ; `` there are no sounds of war ; everything is quiet , your Excellency . ''
Out of every gate the crowds poured .
They swarmed about the English bastilles like an invasion of ants , but noisier than those creatures , and carried off the artillery and stores , then turned all those dozen fortresses into monster bonfires , imitation volcanoes whose lofty columns of thick smoke seemed supporting the arch of the sky .
The King objected that he could not venture toward Rheims with those strong places on the Loire in his path .
In the afternoon of that day they came in a body to hold one of these councils of war ; and while they waited for Joan to join them they discussed the situation .
Now this discussion is not set down in the histories ; but I was there , and I will speak of it , as knowing you will trust me , I not being given to beguiling you with lies .
Says I , `` Old man , I 'll be frank with you .
`` Now tell me -- is this to go on forever ?
Ai n't there anything else for a change ? ''
I 'LL take it out of you .
Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness , hey ?
`` Well , you 're innocent , ai n't you !
Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ?
No , nobody , says they .
I was pretty near certain I 'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so I says to myself , like as not that nigger 's hiding over there ; anyway , says I , it 's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt .
So they started , and I lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward .
It was dark as pitch there ; but I said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , `` Jim ! ''
-- I most wish 't it had been me , I do . ''
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river .
`` I is , is I ?
Well , you answer me dis : Did n't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas ' to de tow-head ? ''
No , says I , I 'd feel bad -- I 'd feel just the same way I do now .
Well , then , says I , what 's the use you learning to do right when it 's troublesome to do right and ai n't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same ?
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says :
`` What 're you alassin ' about ? ''
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I .
He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say `` Your Grace , '' or `` My Lord , '' or `` Your Lordship '' -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain `` Bridgewater , '' which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out :

`` But YOU always went to church . ''
She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge .
Well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out :
`` Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b'lieve you , and take back everything I said . ''
`` Yes , it is -- and I could a had it if I 'd been big enough ; I see him FIRST .
He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook , and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man .
He was a Baptist .
Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well .
Yes , I remember now , he DID die .
But it did n't save him .
Yes , it was mortification -- that was it .
But there war n't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid , and Mary , and the rest of the tribe .
`` Oh , DO , '' says Aunt Sally ; `` it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world .
It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we can't let you walk .
And after they got a little quiet again she says :
`` So it was -- I noticed it .
`` It ai n't no use , it ca n't be done .
`` Clah to goodness I hai n't no notion , Miss ' Sally .
She wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain ' dah no mo ' now . ''
Give a body a rest !
But he 's got to have it .
Tom thought a minute or two , and says :
Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient .
But it didn't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres .
Why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally war n't over it yet ; she warn't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings .
So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room .
My , but there was a crowd there !
I allowed another walk would do me good ; but I could n't stir .
But before she could break it open she dropped it and run -- for she see something .
And so did I .
It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress ; and that old doctor ; and Jim , in HER calico dress , with his hands tied behind him ; and a lot of people .
I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy , and rushed .
It came whence ALL impulses , good or bad , come -- from OUTSIDE .
It was not HE that turned over the new leaf -- she did it for him .
Different results of the one Master Impulse : the necessity of securing one 's self approval .
When it stops , the man is dead .
I do it every day .
For it is hatefully interesting !
As soon as I come across a golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it , I can not help myself .
The rest of my days will be spent in patching and painting and puttying and caulking my priceless possession and in looking the other way when an imploring argument or a damaging fact approaches .
I was fired with a longing to ascend the Amazon .
It was in this way .
Circumstance , to help or hurt another man , made him lose a fifty-dollar bill in the street ; and to help or hurt me , made me find it .
In all that time my temperament has not changed , by even a shade .
THE SERGEANT : `` Did I know him ?

They took a name .
They had pass-words , grips , and signs ; they had secret meetings ; their initiations were conducted with gloomy pomps and ceremonies , at midnight .
All the lights were turned low , so low that the congregation sat in a deep and solemn gloom .
This profound and increasingly impressive stillness endured for some time -- the best preparation for music , spectacle , or speech conceivable .
I should think our show people would have invented or imported that simple and impressive device for securing and solidifying the attention of an audience long ago ; instead of which they continue to this day to open a performance against a deadly competition in the form of noise , confusion , and a scattered interest .
He then asked her the meaning of `` bane and antidote , '' which she was unable to give .
`` Now , my dear lady , can anything be more ridiculous than to teach a child Cato 's Soliloquy , who does not know how many pence there are in sixpence ? ''
The following is a brave attempt at a solution , but it failed to liquify :

There are always a few royal heirs in stock and ready to take her place -- ready and more than anxious to do it , although she is their own mother .

You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries , and you can find out the life-histories of all those people , too .
You will then have listed fifteen hundred celebrities , and you can trace the authentic life-histories of the whole of them .
Save one -- far and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation -- Shakespeare !
Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory .
There are many reasons why , and they have been furnished in cart-loads ( of guess and conjecture ) by those troglodytes ; but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together , and is abundantly sufficient all by itself -- HE HAD N'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD .
There is no way of getting around that deadly fact .
And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance .
The praise made Sally poignantly happy , but he was fair and just enough to say it was rightfully due to Aleck rather than to himself , since but for her he should never have had the money .
`` It 's the way YOU feel , and if you were n't so immorally pious you 'd be honest and say so . ''

We were partly convinced , but said it probably could n't happen again .
She did her work on narrow slips of paper , and we pocketed them as fast as she turned them out , to show as curiosities .
I bought one , and we went away very much excited .
So he sent out an aide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog .

Well , from nursing those portraits so long , I have come at last to have a perfect infatuation for art .
He does any kind of artist work a body wants , having a genius that is universal , like Michael Angelo .
But he did not care for it .
He was about eleven years old ; he had alert , intent black eyes ; he was quick of movement ; there was no hesitation , no uncertainty about him anywhere ; there was a military decision in his lip , his manner , his speech , that was an astonishing thing to see in a little chap like him ; he wasted no words ; his answers always came so quick and brief that they seemed to be part of the question that had been asked instead of a reply to it .
When he stood at table with his fly-brush , rigid , erect , his face set in a cast-iron gravity , he was a statue till he detected a dawning want in somebody's eye ; then he pounced down , supplied it , and was instantly a statue again .
I often heard him slapping and banging at these imaginary creatures with as much zeal as if they had been real .
The summer semester was in full tide ; consequently the most frequent figure in and about Heidelberg was the student .

`` It is no time to bandy words .

It was agreed all around that we had done wisely , because it would be just as enjoyable to walk DOWN the Neckar as up it , and it could not be needful to walk both ways .
Her father ransacked the country for her , but found not a trace of her .
The months dragged on , all hope forsook the old man , he ceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures , he devoted himself to pious works , and longed for the deliverance of death .
Germany is rich in folk-songs , and the words and airs of several of them are peculiarly beautiful -- but `` The Lorelei '' is the people 's favorite .
I could not endure it at first , but by and by it began to take hold of me , and now there is no tune which I like so well .
A fable of old Times so terrifies , Leaves my heart so thoughtful .
I saw no idiots there , but the captain said , `` Because of late years the government has taken to lugging them off to asylums and otherwheres ; and government wants to cripple the factory , too , and is trying to get these Dilsbergers to marry out of the family , but they do n't like to . ''
So it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed .
The limbs near the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel .
The level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is laid out in handsome pleasure grounds , shaded by noble trees and adorned at intervals with lofty and sparkling fountain-jets .
It seems like a rather aimless and stupid existence .
People say that Germany , with her damp stone houses , is the home of rheumatism .

One is the bell-ringing to remind a clock-caked town that it is church-time , and another is the reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of `` notices '' which everybody who is interested has already read in the newspaper .
It is not merely unnecessary , it is generally painful ; for the average clergyman could not fire into his congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself , unless the weapon scattered shamefully .
The average clergyman , in all countries and of all denominations , is a very bad reader .
A person who does not appreciate the exceeding value of pauses , and does not know how to measure their duration judiciously , can not render the grand simplicity and dignity of a composition like that effectively .
Think of a monument a mile high , standing on a pedestal two miles high !
This is what the Matterhorn is -- a monument .
No man ever had such a monument as this before ; the most imposing of the world 's other monuments are but atoms compared to it ; and they will perish , and their places will pass from memory , but this will remain .
This thought gave us a shock .

We frequently looked , but in vain , for traces of our unfortunate companions ; we bent over the ridge and cried to them , but no sound returned .
Convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor hearing , we ceased from our useless efforts ; and , too cast down for speech , silently gathered up our things , and the little effects of those who were lost , and then completed the descent .
A little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on the Montanvert , and had a view of six miles , right up the great glacier , the famous Mer de Glace .
This is a great and justly honored day -- a day which is worthy of the veneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and nationalities -- a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and speech ; und meinem Freunde -- no , meinEN FreundEN -- meinES FreundES -- well , take your choice , they 're all the same price ; I do n't know which one is right -- also !

What is the real function , the essential function , the supreme function , of language ?
Then if we can do it with words of fonetic brevity and compactness , why keep the present cumbersome forms ?
I hold in my hand the proof of it .
It is all one sentence , eagerly and breathlessly uttered , without break or pause in it anywhere .

I have heard of one French sermon which closed in this odd yet eloquent way :
I could see his admiration of me in his eye , and I did what everybody else would do -- admired the child four times as much , knowing I would get four times as much of his admiration .
I was making my way into his heart .
About sixty years ago that man was a young fellow of twenty-three , and had just come home from a three years ' whaling voyage .
He came into that village of his , happy and proud because now , instead of being chief mate , he was going to be master of a whaleship , and he was proud and happy about it .

I am not accustomed to dealing in these fulsome compliments , and I am probably overdoing it a little ; but -- well , my old affectionate admiration for Governor Roosevelt has probably betrayed me into the complimentary excess ; but I know him , and you know him ; and if you give him rope enough -- I mean if -- oh yes , he will justify that compliment ; leave it just as it is .

If you nullify the peril which collisions threaten you with , you nullify the only very serious peril which attends voyages in the great liners of our day , and makes voyaging safer than staying at home .
I do not know anything so sad as a dinner where you are going to get up and say something by-and-by , and you do not know what it is .
You sit and wonder and wonder what the gentleman is going to say who is going to introduce you .
You know that if he says something severe , that if he will deride you , or traduce you , or do anything of that kind , he will furnish you with a text , because anybody can get up and talk against that .

But she forgot one factor -- the King , shadow of that substance named La Tremouille .

The court saw the priest 's game , and watched his play with a cruel eagerness .
The time was ripe now , and Beaupere quietly and stealthily sprang his trap :
`` Yes , and by command of God .
But that it was His will I would not have come .

But if this golden opportunity to recover France was wasted , said she , `` I give you twenty years to do it in . ''
`` Yes , many did , but I did not know their reason for it . ''
The judges laid their heads together and began to talk now .
And now a thing was noticeable again which had been noticeable more than once before -- that there was pity for Joan in the hearts of many of these people .
Whenever she had been in great danger it had manifested itself , and now it was apparent again -- manifest in a pathetic dumb sorrow which was visible in many faces .
She buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud , and it got so dark we could n't see Tom .
We was afraid every minute he would touch Tom , and then we would be goners , and no help ; but Tom was already on his way back , and when we felt his hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden , and my heart fell down 'mongst my other works , because I could n't tell in the dark but it might be the professor !
Tom was clean beat .
He said it war n't his notion of England ; he thought England looked like America , and always had that idea .
So he said we better have breakfast , and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to London .
Tom said to keep a sharp lookout , all around , everywheres , because we'd got to find an oasis or there war n't no telling what would happen .
So we done it .
Two hours -- three hours -- just gazing and gazing , and nothing but sand , sand , SAND , and you could see the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it .
So they shook hands on the bargain , and the dervish got out his box and rubbed the salve on the driver 's right eye , and the hill opened and he went in , and there , sure enough , was piles and piles of gold and jewels sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down .
You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink .
We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it , just to have company , though it war n't going our way .
We never went very near it , because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people 's camels and break up their caravans .
Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall , and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun , and it was coming like the nation , too .
And he said there was a hole in the pyramid , and you could go in there with candles , and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel , and come to a large room in the stomach of that stone mountain , and there you would find a big stone chest with a king in it , four thousand years old .
I said to myself , then , if that ain't a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him , for even Methusalem war n't that old , and nobody claims it .
You set your compass and sail west as straight as a dart , till you find the United States .
If it 's daytime when you strike it , bulge right on , straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast , and in an hour and three quarters you 'll hit the mouth of the Mississippi -- at the speed that I 'm going to send you .
You 'll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable -- sorter like a washbowl turned upside down -- and you 'll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way , long before you get there , and you can pick out the Mississippi without any trouble .
You 'll come down low then , so as you can examine the villages as you spin along .
You 'll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteen minutes , and you 'll recognize ours when you see it -- and if you do n't , you can yell down and ask . ''
This did not remind me of anything further to say , so I got out , with the other boys , and we went away with that indefinite sense you have often had of being filled but not fatted .
`` It seems a pity not to keep it , '' said Satan .
This kind is called the Lucky Cat .
There in the parlor , and Marget standing looking at us , astonished .
She was feeble and pale , but I knew that those conditions would not last in Satan 's atmosphere , and it turned out so .
This was not true ; no door was open ; we entered through the walls or the roof or down the chimney , or somehow ; but no matter , what Satan wished a person to believe , the person was sure to believe , and so Marget was quite satisfied with that explanation .
And then the main part of her mind was on Traum , anyway ; she could n't keep her eyes off him , he was so beautiful .
I hoped he would show off some , but he did n't .
He seemed only interested in being friendly and telling lies .
He said he was an orphan .
That made Marget pity him .
Philip said he hoped so , too ; and that made me shudder again .
The rack was there , and the other instruments , and there was a smoky lantern or two hanging on the walls and helping to make the place look dim and dreadful .
She got no satisfaction out of us , our tongues being tied .
We talked together , and I had the idea of trying to reform Satan and persuade him to lead a better life .
I told him about all those things he had been doing , and begged him to be more considerate and stop making people unhappy .
`` I have wrought well for the villagers , though it does not look like it on the surface .
Your race never know good fortune from ill .
They are always mistaking the one for the other .
That is human life .
A child 's first act knocks over the initial brick , and the rest will follow inexorably .
If you could see into the future , as I can , you would see everything that was going to happen to that creature ; for nothing can change the order of its life after the first event has determined it .
That is , nothing will change it , because each act unfailingly begets an act , that act begets another , and so on to the end , and the seer can look forward down the line and see just when each act is to have birth , from cradle to grave . ''
Seppi saw that in her eye which emboldened him to ask if we might go up and help him pass his time .
There was a sound of tramping and scraping outside , and a crowd came solemnly in , with heads uncovered , and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed .
So the bear went .
When he came back , he said :
