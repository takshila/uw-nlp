The soldier lit his match , and drew .
`` Secret society , '' he repeated , with his pipe between his teeth and the match flaring , in response to his words .
He threw his match aside , and walked to his machine .
Jest to help believing .
It would have been obviously out of place there .
`` What can we do ? ''
They ai n't doin ' us good . ''
`` Jest as we 're gettin ' hold of 'em , '' muttered Grubb , `` up comes a counter-attraction .
Go it , Bert ! ''
`` The blessed thing goes up if you only LOOK overboard , '' he remarked , and assailed the locker .
He found among other items several tins of liquid cocoa containing explicit directions for opening that he followed with minute care .
Of all these world-forces and gigantic designs Bert Smallways knew nothing until he found himself in the very focus of it all and gaped down amazed on the spectacle of that giant herd of air-ships .
He had never before seen anything so vast and disciplined as this tremendous park .
For the first time in his life he really had an intimation of the extraordinary and quite important things of which a contemporary may go in ignorance .
Before Bert could decide to say anything more he was whisked up by the two soldiers .
Some one ran before him with the portfolio , and he was borne rapidly along the broad avenue between the gas generators and the airships , rapidly and on the whole smoothly except that once or twice his bearers stumbled over hose-pipes and nearly let him down .
`` We 'd have started , '' he said , `` in another half-hour !
You did n't give yourself much time ! ''
Do n't you know ?
The progress of the airship was not nearly so smooth as a balloon ; he could feel a regular swaying up , up , up and then down , down , down , and the throbbing and tremulous quiver of the engines .
Then he referred to the other drawings in the portfolio .
came a vast impact out of the zenith , followed by another huge roll , and all about him the tumbled clouds flashed red and lurid in response to flashes unseen , revealing immense gulfs .
A red fire spluttered and blazed close by the electricians at their work , and red gleams xan up the vertical steel mast and threads of copper wire towards the zenith .
They were all keeping very still , as if waiting to hear what news might presently be given them .
Far away , across many hundreds of miles of desolation , other wireless masts would be clicking , and snapping , and waking into responsive vibration .
Perhaps those throbs upon the ethers wasted themselves upon a regardless world .
When the men spoke , they spoke in low tones .
Now and then a bird shrieked remotely , and once a wolf howled .
All these things were set in the immense cold spaciousness of the wild .
`` Think of it , Smallways : there 's war everywhere !
Down in South America even they are fighting among themselves !
One yellow face had craned over and looked at him , and for one enigmatical instant met his eyes ... .
The Prince did not understand him and disregarded what he said .
He pointed his gloved finger to the machine and turned to the bird-faced officer with some remark in German .
Then he spoke -- it seemed eloquently .
Bert watched him and guessed his meaning .
`` I car n't , '' said Bert , dismissing that .
`` I got to be worked up . ''
Bert fell back upon imprecations , then he went up to the shed , cursorily examined the possibility of a flank attack , put his gun handy , and set to work , with a convulsive listening pause before each mouthful on the Prince 's plate of corned beef .
What chiefly concerned them was defence against Asiatic raiders swooping for petrol or to destroy weapons or communications .
He launched out into a romantic description of the Butteridge machine and riveted Bert 's attention .
`` I SEE that , '' said Bert , and was smitten silent by a thought .
At that Bert had a little twinge of relief -- he would never meet Butteridge again .
`` They was all right , '' said Teddy , `` and on the way near Leatherhead we saw a man riding on a bicycle . ''
And indeed quite close at hand , where the road curved about below them , the statement that Staminal Bread , the True Staff of Life , was sold only by the International Bread Shops , was flung out with a vigour of yellow and Prussian blue that made the landscape tame .
`` That clock , '' said Sir Isaac interrupting in the dining-room , `` is a fake . ''
From first to last Mr. Brumley never said a single word about Euphemia and the young matrimony and all the other memories this house enshrined .
These two ladies seemed to Mr. Brumley to offer a certain resistance of spirit to the effusion of Lady Beach-Mandarin , rather as two small anchored vessels might resist the onset of a great and foaming tide , but after a time it was clear they admired her greatly .
His attention was , however , a little distracted from them by the fact that he was the sole representative of the more serviceable sex among five women and so in duty bound to stand by Lady Harman and assist with various handings and offerings .
`` Your _little_ Chicks . ''
`` Dodging about the garden !
It could n't be like that .
So women have felt in tumbrils .
A nightmare of butlers , a galaxy of possible butlers , filled her soul .
Charterson wanted a seat , and presently got it ; his maiden speech on the Sugar Bounties won a compliment from Mr. Evesham ; and Harman , who would have piloted a monoplane sooner than address the House , decided to be one of those silent influences that work outside our national assembly .
`` I had to go before the committee , '' said Susan .
'Don't you be frightened , my dear , ' he says .
'Well , ' I says , '_somebody's_ got to earn something , ' and that made them laugh in a sort of fatherly way , and after that there was n't any difficulty .
You see it was after Father 's Inquest , and everybody was disposed to be kind to us .
'Pity they ca n't all go instead of this educational Tommy Rot , ' the old gentleman says .
`` If you open -- -- I suppose the old shops get hurt .
They asked him what allowance he gave his wife .
Sent a prepaid reply telegram . ''
It was silly of me , '' said Lady Harman .
In his flurry he went on denying ... .
I have a perfect right to go out to lunch -- -- ''
`` I think I can understand that , my lady , '' said Susan .
And it seems so silly when I have it that I should really be wanting money ... . ''
`` And the worst time of the year coming . ''
`` I mean -- someone .
It 's the feeling of freedom , of being yourself and on your own .
It's the poverty makes 'em what they are ... .
And after all , somebody 's got to lose the lodgers if this place gets them .
Nobody is n't going to build a Hostel for them . ''
`` I was frightened before .
They were developing upon lines that here and there disregarded Mr. Brumley's ideas very widely ; they gained in practicality what perhaps they lost in social value , through the entirely indirect relations between Mr. Brumley on the one hand and Sir Isaac on the other .
For Sir Isaac manifestly did not consider and would have been altogether indisposed to consider Mr. Brumley as entitled to plan or suggest anything of the slightest importance in this affair , and whatever of Mr. Brumley reached that gentleman reached him in a very carefully transmitted form as Lady Harman 's own unaided idea .
`` Run the hostels without him , Elly , '' he propounded .
He beat at the arms of his chair and then put a hand to his throat .
`` Daddy 's ill again , '' said Florence .
She darted to the French window that opened into the dining-room from the balcony .
`` Doctor Greve ! ''
Next morning he seemed still stronger .
He was restless and at last demanded Lady Harman again .
For three years her excuse for standing -- everything , had been these hostels .
There is n't anyone to enforce them .
`` Only , '' he said , `` although it is the one thing I desire , although it is the one return you can make me -- -- .
But whatever I have done -- I have done willingly ... . ''
Decorated cloth , 12mo .
There was a swirl of the water like the swirl about a screw propeller , and he gripped the Sea Lady and the ladder just in time , as it seemed to him , to prevent his being washed far out into the Channel .
`` I 'm not so sure of that .
`` And that is really what you came for ? ''
All making the very most they can of it .
Cheerful home , eh ?
`` That reminds me .
Think of the disillusionment -- the shock -- the discovery of such weakness . ''
My cousin lifted his eyebrows and shook his head in agreement .
`` And -- -- ? ''
`` Fin and all ? ''
`` I 'm a friend of Miss Glendower . ''
`` Of course all that does n't excuse me in the least .
But it 's a sort of excuse for _your_ being dragged into this bother . ''
He repeated , `` It 's not my way . ''
I write a `` secure and disciplined service , '' and I intend by that not simply an exterior but an interior discipline .
Let us have done with this unnatural theory that men may submit unreservedly to the guidance of `` self-interest . ''
Men and women _want_ to have a code of honour .
In the army , for example , there is among the officers particularly , a tradition of courage , cleanliness and good form , more imperative than any law ; in the little band of men who have given the world all that we mean by science , the little host of volunteers and underpaid workers who have achieved the triumphs of research , there is a tradition of self-abnegation and of an immense , painstaking , self-forgetful veracity .
They add something to the worth of every man who comes under them .
`` Houses unfit for human habitation , rooms destitute of light and ventilation , overcrowding in rural cottages , contaminated water supplies , accumulations of every description of filth and refuse , a total absence of drainage , a reign of unbelievable dirt in milk-shops and slaughter-houses , a total neglect of bye-laws , and an inadequate supervision by officials who are frequently incompetent ; such , in a general way , is the picture that is commonly presented in the reports of inquiries in certain rural districts made by medical officers of the Local Government Board . ''
For example , the Anti-Socialist declares that Socialism `` abolishes property . ''
He makes believe there is a hard absolute thing called `` property '' which must either be or not be , which is now , and which will not be under Socialism .
Having achieved this initial absurdity , he then asks in a tone of bitter protest whether a man may not sleep in his own bed , and is he to do nothing if he finds a coal-heaver already in possession when he retires ?
So much Marx did for Socialism .
But if he broadened its application to the world , he narrowed its range to only the economic aspect of life .
He arrested for a time the discussion of its biological and moral aspects altogether .
You will probably live as a tenant in a house which may either stand alone or be part of a terrace or collegiate building , but instead of having a private landlord , exacting of rent and reluctant of repairs , your house landlord will very probably be , and your ground landlord will certainly be , the municipality , the great Birmingham or London or Hampshire or Glasgow or such-like municipality ; and your house will be built solidly and prettily instead of being jerry-built and mean-looking , and it will have bathroom , electric light , electrically equipped kitchen and so forth , as every modern civilized house might have and should have now .
If your taste runs to a little close garden of your own , you will probably find plenty of houses with one ; if that is not so , and you want it badly , you will get other people of like tastes to petition the municipality to provide some , and if that will not do , you will put yourself up as a candidate for the parish or municipal council to bring this about .
You can not grasp too clearly that _Socialism will abolish rates_ absolutely .
Through that , and in relation and service to that , they must , it would seem , spend their political activities ( I am writing now only of political activities ) if they are not to be spent very largely to waste .
There can be no denying the great quantity of `` Good Will '' and constructive intention that finds a place in its very miscellaneous ranks , but the strong strain of obstinate and irreconcilable individualism is equally indisputable .
To have become a Socialist is to have learnt something , to have made an intellectual and a moral step , to have discovered a general purpose in life and a new meaning in duty and brotherhood .
But to have become a Socialist is not , as many suppose , to have become generally wise .
Rather in realizing the nature of the task that could be done , one realizes also one 's insufficiencies , one 's want of knowledge , one's need of force and training .
Wild Asses of the Devil !
I thought somehow it was a joke .
`` Recently he 's been explaining himself , '' said Dodd .
`` Deshman comes again with a new and disconcerting habit of tapping the panelling and measuring the thickness of the walls when he thinks no one is looking , and then a sister of Mr. Blandish and a friend , a woman , yet not so much a woman as a disembodied intelligence in a feminine costume with one of those impalpable relationships with Deshman that people have with one another in the world of Henry James , an association of shadows , an atmospheric liaison .
Mr. Compton Mackenzie was in trouble about his excess luggage , for example .
The brothers Chesterton , Mr. Maurice Baring , and Mr. Belloc sat up all night in the _wagon-restaurant_ consuming beer enormously and conversing upon immortality and whether it extends to Semitic and Oriental persons .
At the end of the train , I remember , there was to have been a horse-van containing Mr. Maurice Hewlett 's charger -- Mr. Hewlett himself , I believe , was left behind by accident at the Gare de Lyons -- Mr. Cunninghame Graham 's Arab steed , and a large , quiet sheep , the inseparable pet of Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson ... .
`` But that merely helps my case .
`` But is this in reality true ?

Your literature and philosophy are really just the private entertainment of old gentlemen out of the hurly-burly and ambitious young men too delicate to hunt or shoot .
Thought is nothing in the world until it begins to operate in will and act , and the history of mankind does n't show now , and it never has shown , any consecutive relation to human thinking .
And he was short and presently rather uncivil in his replies to Wilkins .
Get something technical and first-hand that would rather score off Kipling .
Henceforth the battle moves swiftly to complete the disaster of Red .
Shaken and demoralised , that unfortunate general is now only for retreat .
His next move , of which I have no picture , is to retreat the infantry he has so wantonly exposed back to the shelter of the church , to withdraw the wreckage of his right into the cover of the cottage , and -- one last gleam of enterprise -- to throw forward his left gun into a position commanding Blue 's right .
Mr. Skinner , when he appeared , was a large-faced man , with a lisp and a squint that made him look over the top of your head , slashed slippers that appealed to Mr. Bensington 's sympathies , and a manifest shortness of buttons .
He held his coat and shirt together with one hand and traced patterns on the black-and-gold tablecloth with the index finger of the other , while his disengaged eye watched Mr. Bensington 's sword of Damocles , so to speak , with an expression of sad detachment .
He sat back , sighed , threw his unconsumed cigarette into the fire and thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets .
`` That 's precisely what I 'm thinking of .

He struck Redwood as being embarrassed .
`` I 'll cut 'im , '' cried the boy ; `` 'old on , Sir . ''
There were some strange and desperate struggles in obscure places .
`` We are fortunately situated , '' he said , putting the thing tamely .
He spoke to several people about them , and said they were `` marvellous ! ''
and he related to at least seven different persons the well-known story of the flagstone that was lifted from the cellar floor by a growth of fungi beneath .
`` You 'd better let me see that baby , Mrs. Skinner , '' said Redwood .
In a limited way the Vicar had an imagination -- at any rate , the remains of one -- and with young Caddles it took the line of developing the huge possibilities of personal injury such vast muscles must possess .
Every time and always the Vicar got his imagination under .
In spite of the simple instructions of the Vicar -- instructions intended to round off the modest natural life befitting a giant peasant , in the most complete and final manner -- he began to ask questions , to inquire into things , to _think_ .
As he grew from boyhood to adolescence it became increasingly evident that his mind had processes of its own -- out of the Vicar 's control .
`` How is it to be done ? ''
`` That 's legitimate ! ''
His son was sitting under the shadow of a great wall of steel .
He presented himself as a black shape recognisable only by his pose , -- his features were invisible .
She stood looking down upon her lover with her hand resting against the steel .
This was the culmination and end of his dream .
They would carry munitions to Germany if their owners thought they had a sporting chance of not getting caught at it .
I believe that the end of the war will see , not only transit , but shipping , collieries , and large portions of the machinery of food and drink production and distribution no longer under the administration of private ownership , but under a sort of provisional public administration .
The riddle of administration is the most subtle of all those that the would-be prophet of the things that are coming must attempt .
But there can be no doubt of the great educational value of some highly inflected and well-developed language _taught by men to whom it is a genuine means of expression_ .
The broad facts that one could not mistake were a vast feminine discontent and a vast display of feminine energy .
But it was not simply the energies that tended towards this particular type that were set free during the latter half of the nineteenth century .
The ladies who specialised in feminine arts and graces and mysteries were also dissatisfied .
The former type found itself insufficiently respected , and the latter type found itself insufficiently adored .
There are no countries with whom the people of the United States are so likely to develop sympathy and a sense of common values and common interests as with these three , unless it be with the Scandinavian peoples .
The Scandinavian peoples have developed a tendency to an extra-European outlook , to look west and east rather than southwardly , to be pacifist and progressive in a manner essentially American .
So long as the Germans cling to the tawdry tradition of the Empire , so long as they profess militarism , so long as they keep up their ridiculous belief in some strange racial superiority to the rest of mankind , it is absurd to expect any co-operative feeling between them and any other great people .
Let us build no false hopes nor pretend to any false generosities .
And that is the business of the sane Germans too .
That is not to be done by any conscientious sentimentalities , any slobbering denials of unforgettable injuries .
We want no Pro-German Leagues any more than we want Anti-German Leagues .
We want patience -- and silence .
`` Go on , '' I said .

`` She began to weep , saying , between her sobs , and clinging to my arm as she said it , 'Go back -- Go back . '
Horrocks , still silent , sat down abruptly in the chair by her little work-table .
Horrocks ' hand still rested on Raut 's shoulder .
But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband better , knew that grim quiet in his voice , and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil .
`` Very well '' , said Horrocks , and , dropping his hand , turned towards the door .
Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their eyes came near to say .
If Horrocks did know -- everything !
Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet .
The reek of the furnace , a sulphurous vapor streaked with pungent bitterness , seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver .

After a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower edge of the snow .
Below , down what was now a moon-lit and practicable slope , he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-strewn turf He struggled to his feet , aching in every joint and limb , got down painfully from the heaped loose snow about him , went downward until he was on the turf , and there dropped rather than lay beside a boulder , drank deep from the flask in his inner pocket , and instantly fell asleep .
`` Where does he come from , brother Pedro ? ''
`` Yes ; see , '' said Nunez , turning towards him , and stumbled against Pedro 's pail .

They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy and inferiority , and after they had whipped him they appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to do , and he , seeing no other way of living , did submissively what he was told .
Beside the waste of money .
However , I suppose they got to do it -- some of them ... ''
`` Are these -- alive ?
I was anxious to see what he was up to first .
Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my hand , and ready for a rush .
But he never stirred .
So there I sat in the stern of the little canoe , drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea , and with all the host of the stars above me , waiting for something to happen .
`` I ca n't even see it 's myself .
Where the devil are we ? ''
`` It is your own choosing , '' said the man with the withered arm , and glanced at me askance .

He found that as the dawn advanced , and the amount of diffused light increased , the crystal became to all appearance non-luminous .
On this , also , the alert intelligence of Mr. Wace speedily threw light .
These moons were never high in the sky , but vanished as they rose : that is , every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet .

Presently a little Capuchin monkey , very clean , with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes , came down a tree to us and ran beside me , looking up at me and grinning , and presently leapt to my shoulder .
I expect I was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning , recalling what I could of the beautiful strange people I should presently see again .
Oddly enough I had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me ...
Yes , I must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career .
But at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what I felt was indeed a sacred secret .
That beast Fawcett made a joke about the girl in green -- -- ''

There was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of clothes .
He was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure , and stood before the long looking-glass when first he put it on , so astonished and delighted with it that he could hardly turn himself away .
But his mother told him `` No . ''
She told him he must take great care of his suit , for never would he have another nearly so fine ; he must save it and save it , and only wear it on rare and great occasions .
And she took the buttons and twisted them up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished , and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows , and wherever the suit was most likely to come to harm .
`` Good Heavens ! ''
Though she is a wonderful woman , George -- a wonderful woman .

said the gentleman in the corner , with even more force than before , and so finished him .
Your dullest man has but to stick one on , and lo !
mirth , wit , and jollity .
Put an angel in one .
Angelina laughs in your face , the public laughs , the executioner at your martyrdom can hardly light the faggots for laughing .
Often and often I have rebelled , and said , 'I will not have this nose ! '
And from that I went on to talk about the Super Man , for this encounter had suddenly crystallised out a set of realisations that had been for some time latent in my mind .
The business began in January , 1916 , with surveys of the rock in question .
In March , as the winter 's snows abated , the boring machinery began to arrive , by mule as far as possible and then by hand .
Altogether about half a kilometre of gallery had to be made to the mine chamber , and meanwhile the explosive was coming up load by load and resting first here , then there , in discreetly chosen positions .
And while the boring machines bored and the work went on , Lieutenant Malvezzi was carefully working out the problem of `` il massimo effetto dirompimento '' and deciding exactly how to pack and explode his little hoard .
No one could have foretold it .
And it did so completely surprise the Italians as to catch them without any prepared line of positions in the rear .
On the very eve of the big Russian offensive , the Austrians thrust eighteen divisions hard at the Trentino frontier .
But the Italians of such beautiful old places and Vicenza , Marostica , and Bassano could watch the Austrian shells bursting on the last line of hills above the plain , and I have no doubt they felt extremely uneasy .
Below me were the ruins of Arsiero and Velo d'Astico recovered , and across the broad valley rose Monte Cimone with the Italian trenches upon its crest and the Austrians a little below to the north .
A very considerable bombardment was going on and it reverberated finely .
( It is only among mountains that one hears anything that one can call the thunder of guns .
As I sat and listened to the uproar and watched the shells burst on Cimone and far away up the valley over Castelletto above Pedescala , Captain Pirelli pointed out the position of the Austrian frontier .
It slides on the ground ; the silly little wheels that so detract from the genial bestiality of its appearance dandle and bump behind it .
It swings about its axis .
Then I repeated the tour inside .
Unhappily it is the Britain you see most of .
Well , outside this official Britain is 'Greater Britain ' -- the real Britain with which you have to reckon in the future . ''
`` This Greater Britain , '' I asserted , `` is in a perpetual conflict with official Britain , struggling to keep it up to its work , shoving it towards its ends , endeavouring in spite of its tenacious mischievousness of the privileged to keep the peace and a common aim with the French and Irish and Italians and Russians and Indians .
It is to that outer Britain that those Englishmen you found so interesting and sympathetic , Lloyd George and Lord Northcliffe , for example , belong .
It is the Britain of the great effort , the Britain of the smoking factories and the torrent of munitions , the Britain of the men and subalterns of the new armies , the Britain which invents and thinks and achieves , and stands now between German imperialism and the empire of the world .
I do not want to exaggerate the quality of greater Britain .
If the inner set are narrowly educated , the outer set if often crudely educated .
For all its crudity there is a giant spirit in it feeling its way towards the light .
They do not necessarily contradict each other .
The conversion of held-up land and material into workable and actively used material in exchange for national debt may be indeed a positive increase in the wealth of the community .
The nett tendency is towards the disappearance of a reality holding class and the destruction of realities in warfare , and the appearance of a vast _rentier_ class in its place .

`` Who 'd _let_ 'em , I 'd like to know ?
This conviction that the world kingdom of God is the only true method of human service , is so clear and final in my own mind , it seems so inevitably the conviction to which all right-thinking men must ultimately come , that I feel almost like a looker-on at a game of blind-man 's bluff as I watch the discussion of synthetic political ideas .
`` He was not a far-sighted man .
Graham struggled into a sitting position .
`` You must come away ! ''
His face and eyes were resolute , too .
Some one gripped his arm ... .
`` To call on old Warming like this ! ''
Graham 's answer was inarticulate assent .
He wanted very much to respond , to talk , but he did not know how to begin .
We did n't think they could do wrong .
Or else I 've got wiser .
He doubted -- and things are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling them _there_ -- or he would have come to you . ''
`` A man as like you as we could find .
We were going to hypnotise him , to save him the difficulty of acting .
Even now a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring to see you .
The rest of the world hung in suspense .
Life and property , indeed , were secure from violence almost all over the world , zymotic diseases , bacterial diseases of all sorts had practically vanished , everyone had a sufficiency of food and clothing , was warmed in the city ways and sheltered from the weather -- so much the almost mechanical progress of science and the physical organisation of society had accomplished .
But the crowd , he was already beginning to discover , was a crowd still , helpless in the hands of demagogue and organiser , individually cowardly , individually swayed by appetite , collectively incalculable .
The memory of countless figures in pale blue canvas came before his mind .
Millions of such men and women below him , he knew , had never been out of the city , had never seen beyond the little round of unintelligent grudging participation in the world 's business , and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier pleasures .
He thought of his own hopes .
He heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease .
He had a vague persuasion that he could not account for , a sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a huge crowd ' must be watching this place in which their Master amused himself .
And with that promise Graham bought his first lesson in aerial navigation .
`` It 's clearly to your advantage , this journey , '' he said with a loud laugh -- for the air was like strong wine -- '' to teach me quickly and well .
Do I pull this ?
She looked at him with a face of hesitation .
She spoke with an effort .
`` You forget , '' she said , drawing a deep breath .
`` There is a lot of discontent -- social discontent . ''
Nowadays , clearly , there is no more need for such care than if they were butterflies .

He turned to the old man in yellow .
Firstly , then , it must be able to adjudicate upon all international disputes whatever .
It is idle to pretend that even at the present time the idea of the League of Free Nations has secure possession of the British mind .
Such papers as the _Times_ and the _Morning Post_ remain hostile and obstructive to the expression of international ideas .
Most of our elder statesmen seem to have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing during the years of wildest change the world has ever known .
And it continues steadily .
More and more has that paper become the organ of a sort of Oxford Imperialism , three or four years behind the times and very ripe and `` expert . ''
The letter is here given as it was finally printed in the issue of the _Daily Chronicle_ for June 4th , 1917 , under the heading , `` Wanted a Statement of Imperial Policy . ''
They could but they do not .
not one of them is free from the entanglements of past things ; when we look for the wisdom of statesmen we find the cunning of politicians ; when open speech and plain reason might save the world , courts , bureaucrats , financiers and profiteers conspire .

Despair like the despair of children that can weep itself to sleep ... .
Was it battle and massacre that ended that long afternoon here ?

`` Modern child , '' said Sir Richmond .

Will they live in palaces ?
Will they all be healthy ?
... Machines will wait on them .
Perhaps I shall dream of it .
`` I believe that as Mankind grows up this is the business Man has to settle down to and will settle down to . ''
said Belinda amazingly -- for she had been silent for some time , `` the goldfish are on the floor , V.V .
Her soft voice came back after a stillness .
`` I hate all this , '' he said slowly .
It makes all this harder to give up .
And yet , do you know , in the night I was thinking , I was coming to conclusions , very like yours .
`` Yes , '' he said awkwardly , glancing over his shoulder , acutely aware of the promenaders passing close to them .
`` The most wonderful thing in my life , '' he thought .
Well , the thing now was to go to Martin ... .
I wish the Committee room was n't down those abominable House of Commons corridors ... . ''
The statement it makes is , it declares , a mere statement of what we may all perceive and experience .
We all live in the storm of life , we all find our understandings limited by the Veiled Being ; if we seek salvation and search within for God , presently we find him .
Still more disastrous for them has been the virgin birth , with the terrible fascination of its detail for unpoetic minds .
How rich is the literature of authoritative Christianity with decisions upon the continuing virginity of Mary and the virginity of Joseph -- ideas that first arose in Arabia as a Moslem gloss upon Christianity -- and how little have these peepings and pryings to do with the needs of the heart and the finding of God !
Now , six to six and a half is certainly a very tender age , and to these children I find these statements addressed in the book :
He has need of us as we of him .
When at last the individual breaks through the limiting darknesses to him , the irradiation of that moment , the smile and soul clasp , is in God as well as in man .
He has won us from his enemy .
Mr. McCabe in that passage sounds as if he were half-way to `` Oh !
Now we of the modern way would offer the following criticisms upon this apparent compromise between our faith and the current religion .
And the accepted figure of Jesus , instinct with meek submission , is not in the tone of our worship .
It is not by suffering that God conquers death , but by fighting .
These may be necessary sufferings , like hunger and thirst in a campaign ; they do not in themselves bring victory .
The symbol of the crucifixion , the drooping , pain-drenched figure of Christ , the sorrowful cry to his Father , `` My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? ''
The time is at hand when many of the organised Christian churches will be forced to define their positions , either in terms that will identify them with this renascence , or that will lead to the release of their more liberal adherents .
Its probable obligations to Eastern thought are less readily estimated by a European writer .
said I , naming our host .
'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue .
My first was to secure some safe place of refuge , and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive .
I had in mind a battering ram .
I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape .
And at last , in one of the really air-tight cases , I found a box of matches .
For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared .
In part it was a modest _cancan_ , in part a step dance , in part a skirt-dance ( so far as my tail-coat permitted ) , and in part original .
The Time Traveller turned to us .
'Where are the matches ? '
He lit one and spoke over his pipe , puffing .
Why , his nose is as pink as paint ! ''
`` And circumstances certainly point -- ''
I would n't like to mess up your plans , you know .
But I might -- out of sheer funk and misery . ''
he said , and his fat underlip dropped .
`` He may be in the house now ! ''
said the first cabman .
They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret , and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue .
He took up his burden again , and returned upstairs , looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot .
On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished .
`` I ca n't tell you to-night , '' he said .
`` I processed her .
But giving drugs to a cat is no joke , Kemp !
In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier 's shop .
My last difficulty seemed overcome . ''
Then suddenly he was struck violently .
cried Kemp , and suddenly became full of ideas .
The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value .
There is a man in your police station -- Marvel . ''
Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter .
Everything points to a desperate struggle -- the trampled ground , the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received , his splintered walking-stick ; but why the attack was made , save in a murderous frenzy , it is impossible to imagine .
That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences .
And as the evening advanced , the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men , and noisy with the yelping of dogs .
`` Sorry , '' said Adye a little hoarsely , and moistened his lips with his tongue .
Suppose he were to take his luck with a shot ?
`` The Invisible Man ! ''
he cried to the navvies , with a vague indicative gesture , and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase .
`` Once I get the haul of them -- _Lord_ ! ''
He was naturally thoughtful and reserved , and greatly sustained in that by an innate rectitude of body and an overhanging and forward inclination of the upper part of his face and head .
His lightest interest was cricket , but he did not take that lightly .
His chief holiday was to go to a cricket match , which he did as if he was going to church , and he watched critically , applauded sparingly , and was darkly offended by any unorthodox play .
His wife was a pink , short , wilfully smiling , managing , ingratiating , talkative woman , who was determined to be pleasant , and take a bright hopeful view of everything , even when it was not really bright and hopeful .
Mr. Polly made an indeterminate noise .
When , a month later , he came out of the Clapham side door at last into the bright sunshine of a fine London day , with a dazzling sense of limitless freedom upon him , he did nothing more adventurous than order the cabman to drive to Waterloo , and there take a ticket for Easewood .
she said , `` it 's cousin Elfrid ! ''
Mr. Polly 's eye fell first upon the bride ; the sight of her filled him with a curious stir of emotion .
Then his mind passed to Mrs. Larkins and the bonnet that was to gain such a hold upon him ; it seemed to be flag-signalling as she advanced , and to the two eager , unrefined sisters he was acquiring .
`` There 's a kind of place here , '' said Mr. Polly , `` where we might have some flowers in pots . ''
`` I ca n't jump , mind ye , '' she repeated , pressing her lips together .
`` He might git stuck in it . ''
`` Do I look like it ? ''
In Europe there are no bones nor other remains of the creature which made these objects , simply the objects themselves .
For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely un-human but intelligent monkey .
But in the old world the primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our own world .
In America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this primitive stage .
Each of them was in a little world of its own .
Not only a new kind of community but a new kind of man comes into history with the development of the Jews .
But he marched by way of Tyre .
There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of Darius , the king of kings .
Rome triumphed over Carthage , but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was to merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew .
The slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of work that could be done by gangs .
And almost all domestic service was performed by slaves .
They were artizans , supervisors and so forth , workers of a new money-paid class working in competition with slave workers ; but we do not know what proportion they made of the general population .
One of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this great period was Innocent III ( 1198-1216 ) who was so fortunate as to become Pope before he was thirty-eight .
In the end Rome defeated him and destroyed his dynasty , but he left the prestige of the church and Pope so badly wounded that its wounds festered and led to its decay .
It ceased to be a little trickle from mind to mind ; it became a broad flood , in which thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated .
This four years ' struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral strain for the people of the United States .
In the border states brothers and cousins , even fathers and sons , would take opposite sides and find themselves in antagonistic armies .
He was a clear-minded man in the midst of much confusion .
He was opposed to slavery , but slavery he held to be a secondary issue ; his primary purpose was that the United States should not be torn into two contrasted and jarring fragments .
In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery ; only Egypt and the coast were known .
Wonderful races of men like the pygmies , strange beasts like the okapi , marvellous fruits and flowers and insects , terrible diseases , astounding scenery of forest and mountain , enormous inland seas and gigantic rivers and cascades were revealed ; a whole new world .
Graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult .
`` It will never do for you to wear that black .
You will be as rapid as possible ? ''
`` You will find the fashions altered , Sire , '' he said .
`` A capillotomist -- precisely !
He is one of the finest artists in the world . ''
said the man in red in a resolute voice .
He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it .
Then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that .
He suddenly realised what this might be , and stepped back to regard it .
And his people awaited him !
These were the people who were on his side .
The guards before him marched on ; those about him stopped as he did .
The throbbing had something to do with the lights .
A wedge of red a little way along the vista caught his eye .
Weapons flashed and rose and fell , heads vanished at the edge of the contest , and other heads replaced them , the little flashes from the green weapons became little jets of smoky grey while the light lasted .
`` We have conquered Cram , '' he said , `` completely conquered Cram -- there is not an examination left in the world .
Are n't you glad ? ''
`` Of course not .
Who is that distinguished looking man ? ''
He found a monoplane in charge of an aeronaut awaiting him on the westward stage .
Seen close this mechanism was no longer small .
Its lateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of a bee 's wing , and made of some sort of glassy artificial membrane , cast their shadow over many hundreds of square yards .
And with that promise Graham bought his first lesson in aerial navigation .
She looked at him with a face of hesitation .
It is an illusion in the minds of men . ''
Show me the workers .
became at last a continuous shouting as they drew near the Government quarter .
`` Ostrog , '' said Asano , `` will be in the small offices beyond there . ''
You dream of human equality -- of some sort of socialistic order -- you have all those worn-out dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and vivid in your mind , and you would rule this age that you do not understand . ''
Over all the huge expanse of the ruins swayed and eddied the shouting people ; and here and there the black banners of the revolutionary societies ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of organisation in the chaos .
He wished passionately for the gift of moving speech .
Throb , throb , throb -- throb , throb , throb ; up he drove .
What did they mean to do ?
In a moment he understood their tactics , and his resolution was taken .
Aeroplanes were all about him , circling wildly to avoid him , as it seemed .
The big machine heeled and swayed as the fear-maddened men scrambled to the stern for their weapons .
A score of bullets sung through the air , and there flashed a star in the thick glass wind-screen that protected him .
The aeroplane slowed and dropped to foil his stroke , and dropped too low .
I 've got to stay at home and remain in a state of suspended animation . ''
That Mr. Manning loved her presented itself to her bloodlessly , stilled from any imaginative quiver or thrill of passion or disgust .
In the first place there were not so many suitable advertisements as she had expected .
She sat down by the paper-rack with a general feeling of resemblance to Vivie Warren , and looked through the Morning Post and Standard and Telegraph , and afterward the half-penny sheets .
Teddy Widgett hovered on the fringe of all these gatherings , blinking at Ann Veronica and occasionally making a wildly friendly dash at her , and carrying her and Miss Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity of other youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings .
She had been working upon a ribbon of microtome sections of the developing salamander , and he came to see what she had made of them .
She stood up and he sat down at the microscope , and for a time he was busy scrutinizing one section after another .
And at the sight something leaped within her .
`` Mr. Ramage , '' she said , `` I ca n't -- Not now .
The youth with the hair brushed back and the spectacled Scotchman joined in the fray for and against the women 's vote .
`` It would suit me . ''
Some one hidden from Ann Veronica appeared to be marshalling the assembly .
`` We have to get in , I think , '' said a nice little old lady in a bonnet to Ann Veronica , speaking with a voice that quavered a little .
`` My dear , can you see in this light ?
Whatever anticipation Ann Veronica had formed of this vanished in the reality .
Insulting cries became frequent and various , but for the most part she could not understand what was said .
A lean young man in spectacles pursued her for some time , crying `` Courage !
Somebody threw a dab of mud at her , and some of it got down her neck .
She found herself talking to Capes in an undertone of rational admission .
I was rude and stupid .
We were talking about the suffrage -- and I rather scoffed . ''
`` It astonishes me that I do n't , '' said Manning , in a tone of intense self-enjoyment .
`` You have been very kind to me , '' she said .
`` But there is something more . ''
He made no answer for three or four seconds .
I love you more .
I did n't dream , not even in my wildest dreaming , that -- you might have any need of me . ''
That knot also would be cut .
She refused coffee , though she knew that anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night .
She took up one of her father 's novels and put it down again , fretted up to her own room for some work , sat on her bed and meditated upon the room that she was now really abandoning forever , and returned at length with a stocking to darn .
`` The moon , '' I reflected .
I thought the moon was a dead world . ''
Then he seemed to fly away from me , and for a moment I lay with all the breath out of my body staring upward .
A toppling crag of the melting stuff had splashed over us , buried us , and now it thinned and boiled off us .
Cavor was crawling in front at the time , and he first was aware of their proximity .
For a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held us so that we forgot even our sphere .
In time , as we grew more accustomed to the darkness , we could make out very small , dim , elusive shapes moving about among those needle-point illuminations .
The medieval priests and persecutors were right and the Moderns are all wrong .
You tamper with it -- and it offers you gifts .
And directly you take them it knocks you to pieces in some unexpected way .
Old passions and new weapons -- now it upsets your religion , now it upsets your social ideas , now it whirls you off to desolation and misery ! ''
But , of course , they may make an advance first . ''
`` Even that goad -- '' he said .
He was , I think , our guide , but I am not sure .
`` Those others are hunting about below .
A flat , long Selenite dashed out of the darkness , and squealed and fled .
I halted , and stopped Cavor with my hand .
`` The lights ! ''
I felt an odd stab of emotion .
I was on the point of asking him to shake hands -- for that , somehow , was how I felt just then -- when he put his feet together and leapt away from me towards the north .
I stood for a moment watching him , then faced westward reluctantly , pulled myself together , and with something of the feeling of a man who leaps into icy water , selected a leaping point , and plunged forward to explore my solitary half of the moon world .
And as I stood there stupid , and perplexed , with this dumbfounding relic in my hand , something very soft and light and chill touched my hand for a moment and ceased to be , and then a thing , a little white speck , drifted athwart a shadow .
It was a tiny snowflake , the first snowflake , the herald of the night .
`` Too late ! ''
I peered through the refracting glass , and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow of sand .
Far away I seemed to see houses and trees , and seaward a curve , vague distortion of a ship hung between sea and sky .
I did not attempt to stand up .
I sat down heedless of the water that came over my feet .
`` It 's near the ebb , '' said the fat little man .
Whatever I did I was resolved that I would keep myself level and right side up .
He ran amuck , killed three , and perforce I had to flee with him after the outrage .
Subsequently we fought with a number who endeavoured to bar our way , and slew seven or eight more .
It says much for the tolerance of these beings that on my recapture I was not instantly slain .
But presently I came upon a body of Selenites , led by two who were curiously different , even in form , from any of these we had seen hitherto , with larger heads and smaller bodies , and much more elaborately wrapped about .
It would seem the Selenites who had come upon him carried him to some point in the interior down `` a great shaft '' by means of what he describes as `` a sort of balloon . ''
The penultimate message describes , with occasionally elaborate detail , the encounter between Cavor and the Grand Lunar , who is the ruler or master of the moon .
Take away this fact of birth and what is there remaining ?
A world without flowers , without the singing of birds , without the freshness of youth , with a spring that brings no seedlings and a year that bears no harvest , without beginnings and without defeats , a vast stagnation , a universe of inconsequent matter -- Death .
Not only does the substance of life vanish if we eliminate births and all that is related to births , but whatever remains , if anything remains , of aesthetic and intellectual and spiritual experience , collapses utterly and falls apart , when this essential substratum of all experience is withdrawn .
So at any rate the world presents itself in the view the New Republican takes .
The analogy with the breeder of cattle is a very misleading one .
Towards that ideal he goes simply and directly , slaughtering and sparing , regardless entirely of any divergent variation that may arise beneath his control .
A young calf with an incipient sense of humour , with a bright and inquiring disposition , with a gift for athleticism or a quaintly-marked hide , has no sort of chance with him at all on that account .
He can throw these proffered gifts of nature aside without hesitation .
Possibly height , weight , presence of dark pigment in the hair , whiteness of skin , presence of hair upon the body , are simple elements in inheritance that will follow Galton 's arithmetical treatment of heredity with some exactness .
The height of one particular person may be due to an exceptional length of leg and neck , of another to an abnormal length of the vertebral bodies of the backbone ; the former may have a rather less than ordinary backbone , the latter a stunted type of limb , and an intermarriage may just as conceivably ( so far as our present knowledge goes ) give the backbone of the first and the legs of the second as it may a very tall person .
To-day the Aristocratic Monarchy is an almost universally accepted fact in the British Empire , and it has so complete an air of unshakable permanence to contrast with its condition in the early nineteenth century that even the fact that it is the only really concrete obstacle to a political reunion of the English-speaking peoples at the present time , seems merely a fact to avoid .
Many people whose judgments are not absolutely despicable hold a theory that unhampered personal freedom for a hundred years has made out of the British type , a type less deliberate and thorough in execution and more noisy and pushful in conduct , restless rather than indefatigable , and smart rather than wise .
American books , American papers , American manners and customs seem all for the ninety and nine .
That allusion to the predominance of fiction brings one round to the question of the Public Library .
But fiction can be .
For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant , and , although the heat was excessive , he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly .
I stopped at the group of people .
I had slept but little , though my wife had succeeded in sleeping , and I rose early .
said I , in a whisper .
I sat up , and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly .
The flying people increased in number .
Steadily , incessantly , each black splash grew and spread , shooting out ramifications this way and that , now banking itself against rising ground , now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley , exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper .
`` We are safe here , '' he repeated ; `` safe here . ''
At last I found myself awake and very hungry .
Now by the action of natural selection , all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases -- they never succumb without a severe struggle , but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead .
The fronds became bleached , and then shrivelled and brittle .
`` Well -- I parleyed , did n't I ? ''
London about me gazed at me spectrally .
Terror seized me , a horror of my temerity .
In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred , and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway .
I turned down St. John 's Wood Road , and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn .
But before the dawn my courage returned , and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards Regent 's Park .
On the summit , towering up to the fading stars , was a third Martian , erect and motionless like the others .
The processes that occur in the remaining portions of the alimentary canal are imperfectly understood .
In carnivorous animals it may be so much reduced as to be practically absent .
An important factor in the diet of the herbivorous animals , and one absent from the food of the carnivora , is that carbohydrate , the building material of all green-meat- [ food ] , cellulose , and there is some ground for thinking that the caecum is probably a region of special fermentive action upon it .
The nasal passages are partially blocked by foliated bony outgrowths , from the inner aspect of their walls , which in life are covered with mucous membrane , and increase the surface sensitive to smell .
; the nasal , the naso-turbinal ( n.t . )
are alike purely motor nerves , small and distributed , to the orbit .
What is a goblet cell ?
Having the notochord confined to the tail .
{ Illustration : Development Section 36 . }
Its presence in development is difficult to account for except on the supposition , that it was once of far greater importance .
-- Examine external characters , nasal grooves -- no internal nares -- fins , spiracle , scales passing over lips , and cloaca .
Frequently the testes are washed out of the male in this operation and ova from the loose ovaries in the female .
Before throwing tail and hinder part of body away , note the myotomes of body wall , the notochord and vertebral body , neural canal , and , in the tail , the haemal canal .

L. , developing lungs .
Her reverie vanished , and by a complex but almost instantaneous movement she had her basket off the rack and the carriage door open .
There , advancing in a string , were Daffy , her elder sister , Theodore , her younger brother , and the dog Toupee .
Sydney and Rom had n't come .
Theodore was hatless , rustily fuzzy-headed , and now a wealth of quasi-humorous gesture .
cried Marjorie , waving the basket .
`` Pretty bit of road , '' said Marjorie .
`` I suppose those birds are rooks , '' she said .
Then the younger people kissed round and were packed off to bed , and the rest of the party went to the door upon the lawn and admired the night .
`` A girl of twenty is a mass of contradictions .
I am sure there is no other attachment -- -- ''
you are n't crying , Madge , are you ? ''
She had felt a queer little repugnance at first with this helpless man , but now that professional nurse who lurks in the composition of so many women , was uppermost .
`` You 'll have all this cleared away , '' said Mr. Pope .
Let us both go _this_ way .
`` No ; with the donkeys .
I am in beastly high spirits .
I feel there will be a cry before night ; but still , I am -- -- I wanted the companionship of an unbroken person .
Mrs. Pope came upon the affair quite by accident .
`` He 'll think twice before he drives another , '' said Mr. Pope , wrenching off his collar ... .
But behind this simple verbal mask was a great fury of mental activity .
said Mrs. Pope , in a hollow voice .
Trafford found Mr. Pope seated sternly at the centre of the writing desk , regarding him with a threatening brow .
One could as soon describe music as tell their conversation .
But the idea of flight together , of the bright awakening in unfamiliar sunshine with none to come between them , had gripped them both .
She was for a simple disappearance , notes on pincushions and defiantly apologetic letters from Boulogne , but his mother 's atmosphere had been a gentler one than her home 's , with a more powerful disposition to dignity .
He still could n't understand that the cantankerous egotism of Pope was indeed the essential man ; it seemed to him a crust of bad manners that reason ought to pierce .
cried Trafford to Dover .
He 's so neat , you know , in his speeches ... .
`` Big , big , bog , '' she said at the sight of Daffy .
asked Christabel , determined to be in the movement .
Them and their children .
It 's like building a temple for flies to buzz in ... .
They parted that night resolved to go to Labrador together , with the broad outline of their subsequent journey already drawn .
Each woke to a morning of sunshine heavy-eyed .
Each found that overnight decision remote and incredible .
It was like something in a book or a play that had moved them very deeply .
They came down to breakfast , and helped themselves after the wonted fashion of several years , Marjorie with a skilful eye to the large order of her household ; the _Times_ had one or two characteristic letters which interested them both ; there was the usual picturesque irruption of the children and a distribution of early strawberries among them .
`` That tin 's _boiling !
what was she herself ?
She became interested in framing an answer to that , and slipped down from the peace of soul she had attained .
I 'm as out as that !
-- and I 've handled the stores pretty freely .
It 's too much for me .
I 've plans -- but it may come to that .
-- I do n't know what they 'll come to . ''
`` The birds will come , '' they explained to each other , `` ducks and geese , long before May .
May , you know , is the latest . ''
`` Every Pinky Dinky 's people are rather good people , and better than most Pinky Dinky 's people .
I disliked Herbert Spencer all my life until I read his autobiography , and then I laughed a little and loved him .
I remember as early as the City Merchants ' days how Britten and I scoffed at that pompous question-begging word `` Evolution , '' having , so to speak , found it out .
That lit things wonderfully for us .
It is one of the books that have made me .
In that I got a supplement and corrective of Kipling .
I prowled alone , curious and interested , through shabby back streets of mean little homes ; I followed canals , sometimes canals of mysteriously heated waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising against blackened walls or a distant prospect of dustbin-fed vegetable gardens , I saw the women pouring out from the potbanks , heard the hooters summoning the toilers to work , lost my way upon slag heaps as big as the hills of the south country , dodged trains at manifestly dangerous level crossings , and surveyed across dark intervening spaces , the flaming uproar , the gnome-like activities of iron foundries .
Then back I came , by the ugly groaning and clanging steam train of that period , to my uncle 's house and lavish abundance of money and more or less furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and Chaminade .
It was , I say , diagrammatic .
It was as jumbled and far more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions of building and development that had surrounded my youth at Bromstead and Penge , but it had a novel quality of being explicable .
He tackled me first in the garden after lunch , and then tried to raise me to enthusiasm by taking me to his potbank and showing me its organisation , from the dusty grinding mills in which whitened men worked and coughed , through the highly ventilated glazing room in which strangely masked girls looked ashamed of themselves , -- '' They 'll risk death , the fools , to show their faces to a man , '' said my uncle , quite audibly -- to the firing kilns and the glazing kilns , and so round the whole place to the railway siding and the gratifying spectacle of three trucks laden with executed orders .
`` Seems to me there 'll come a time when a master will get fined if he do n't run round the works blowing his girls noses for them .
That 's about what it 'll come to . ''
Generally speaking , he hated and despised in equal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he personally was not the most perfect human being conceivable .
( His billiard table was an extra large size , specially made and very inconvenient . )
And he hated Trade Unions because they interfered with his autocratic direction of his works , and his workpeople because they were not obedient and untiring mechanisms to do his bidding .
He was , in fact , a very naive , vigorous human being .
He was about as much civilised , about as much tamed to the ideas of collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African negro .
Suddenly she had become very near to me , and a very big thing , a sort of comprehensive generalisation behind a thousand questions , like the sky or England .
`` Is n't there some walk ? ''
Margaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes .
Then we must make out a time-table as the Baileys do , and BEGIN ! ''
The interest and excitement of setting-up a house , of walking about it from room to room and from floor to floor , or sitting at one 's own dinner table and watching one 's wife control conversation with a pretty , timid resolution , of taking a place among the secure and free people of our world , passed almost insensibly into the interest and excitement of my Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead Division , that shapeless chunk of agricultural midland between the Great Western and the North Western railways .
It presents you with a young couple , bright , hopeful , and energetic , starting out under Altiora 's auspices to make a career .
You figure us well dressed and active , running about in motor-cars , visiting in great people 's houses , dining amidst brilliant companies , going to the theatre , meeting in the lobby .
I do not mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the cynical observer scope and told of a narrower , baser aspect of the fair but limited ambitions of my ostensible self .
He flew off at a tangent .
`` I 'd rather die in Delirium Tremens , '' he cried , `` than be a Crampton or a Lewis ... . ''
Then I resumed my meditation .
I have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and habits of party Liberalism .
In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy .
Regarding the development of the social and individual mental hinterland as the essential thing in human progress , I passed on very naturally to the practical assumption that we wanted what I may call `` hinterlanders . ''
Make a new , more definite place for myself .
You know , of course , there 's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane . ''
Now that I am exiled from the political world , it is possible to estimate just how effectually that grafting has been done .
I ran away from Isabel .
I took hold of the situation with all my strength , put in Britten with sketchy , hasty instructions to edit the paper , and started headlong and with luggage , from which , among other things , my shaving things were omitted , upon a tour round the world .
`` I never knew what it was to be away from you , '' she said .
`` They 're ascribing all sorts of queer ideas to you about the Family , '' he said .
And at the heart of it all , unseen and unsuspected , was the secret of my relations with Isabel -- like a seed that germinates and thrusts , thrusts relentlessly .
One walks silenced through a world that one feels to be full of inaudible accusations .
One can not challenge the assault , get it out into the open , separate truth and falsehood .
Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me , made extraordinary excuses ; men who had presumed on the verge of my world and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise , now took the bold step of flat repudiation .
I became doubtful about the return of a nod , retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto spread to the world .
I still grow warm with amazed indignation when I recall that Edward Crampton , meeting me full on the steps of the Climax Club , cut me dead .
`` By God ! ''
And then I had an open slight from Mrs. Millingham , whom I had counted on as one counts upon the sunrise .
`` Margaret , '' I said , `` I 'm afraid you 'll have to believe it . ''
These questions need discussion -- a magnificent frankness of discussion -- if any standards are again to establish an effective hold upon educated people .
Against every `` shalt not '' there must be a `` why not '' plainly put , -- the `` why not '' largest and plainest , the law deduced from its purpose .
I know there 's an extravagant insubordinate strain in us , but that was n't all .
Passion can always contrive to clothe itself in beauty , strips itself splendid .
`` Is it as good as if she still talked it over with him before she wrote it ?
`` Good-bye , '' I said a little stiffly , conscious of the people upon the platform .
`` Love and fine think'n pretty phrase -- attractive .
Not oth'wise valu'ble . ''
Isabel sat very quiet and still in the compartment , and I stood upon the platform with the door open , with a curious reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from London 's ground .
I showed our tickets , and bought a handful of red roses for her .
At last came the guards crying : `` Take your seats , '' and I got in and closed the door on me .
a compartment to ourselves .
Along the moonlit path went Benham , and when he passed near trees his footsteps became noisy with the rustle and crash of dead leaves .
Some hours later Benham found that the trees and rocks were growing visible again , and he saw a very bright star that he knew must be Lucifer rising amidst the black branches .
He had been asleep , and it was daybreak .
`` Tell me all that you are doing NOW , '' she said to him one afternoon when she had got him to herself during his first visit to Chexington Manor .
Have you joined that thing -- the Union , is it ?
`` We both admit there are limits , '' Prothero concluded .
You think a man ought to take that risk -- '' He reflected .
`` I think -- no -- I think NOT . ''
`` It 's a real business , and she has to live by it .
He hated superiors , he felt for inferiors .
Prothero became vividly red .
`` I do n't know , '' he said , after an interval .
I know there is a better life than this muddle about us , a better life possible now .
Benham had not the slightest desire to lose it from his shoulders .
Then he perceived that the workmen in the chalk pit far below had knocked off and were engaged upon their midday meal .
Is there some one else ? ''
I 'm tired of London too .
I want to go over to Ireland and travel about a little .
His resolution to go round the world carried on his preparations rapidly and steadily , but at the same time his mother 's thwarted and angry bearing produced a torture of remorse in him .
It was constantly in his mind , like the suit of the importunate widow , that he ought to devote his life to the little lady's happiness and pride , and his reason told him that even if he wanted to make this sacrifice he could n't ; the mere act of making it would produce so entirely catastrophic a revulsion .
He could as soon have become a croquet champion or the curate of Chexington church , lines of endeavour which for him would have led straightly and simply to sacrilegious scandal or manslaughter with a mallet .
Of course I shall . ''
`` I want to tell them now , '' said Benham without a word of greeting .
For a moment the landlord was disposed to be defiant .
Then he changed his mind .
She had thought that they just became very simple and natural and quaint .
She had not expected shots at random from the window .
Also in Mahometan districts they pelt men who do not wear fezzes , while occasionally Christians of the shawl-headed or skull-cap persuasions will pelt a fez .
The dogs of Albania are numerous , big , dirty , white dogs , large and hostile , and they attack with little hesitation .
The women of Albania are secluded and remote , and indisposed to be of service to an alien sister .
No bridge has been repaired since the later seventeenth century , and no new bridge has been made since the decline and fall of the Roman Empire .
The scenery is magnificent but precipitous , and many of the high roads are difficult to trace .
`` It 's exactly what I mean .
`` I CA N'T marry , '' he said .
I 've lost my nerve in the presence of women .
They come at one -- done up in a lot of ridiculous clothes , and chattering about all sorts of things that do n't matter ... . ''
I 'm beginning to grasp the unkindliness of priests .
To you , happily married , a woman is just a human being .
But throughout all their travel together that summer Benham was never able to lift Prothero away from his obsession .
It was only presently when the serenity of his own private life began to be ruffled by disillusionment , that he began to realize the intimate connexion of these two systems of thought .
`` Billy , '' he began at last , and stopped again .
`` Billy , in this country somehow one wants to talk like a Russian .
But , of course , she does not want to hamper your work ... . ''
`` Suddenly one night I woke up and lay still , and it was as if I had never seen Amanda before .
Benham affected to ignore those proffered arms .
But they recalled in a swift rush the animal anger that had brought him back to England .
To remind him of desire now was to revive an anger stronger than any desire .
One can not be noble , he had come to perceive , at large ; one must be noble to an end .
He lumped the preventive and destructive forces that keep men dispersed , unhappy , and ignoble under the heading of Prejudice , and he made this Prejudice his fourth and greatest and most difficult limitation .
`` It is preposterous that these monstrous dangers should lower over Europe , because a certain threatening vanity has crept into the blood of a people , because a few crude ideas go inadequately controlled ... .
Does no one see what that metallic beast will do if they once let it loose ?
And suddenly he began to tell White as plainly as he could of the faith that had grown up in his mind .
He spoke with a touch of defiance , with the tense force of a man who shrinks but overcomes his shame .
and the shopman swept the little men back again , shut the lid , waved the box in the air , and there it was , in brown paper , tied up and -- WITH GIP 'S FULL NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE PAPER !
The intelligent parent will understand that I have to go cautiously with Gip .
But I went so far as this one day .
He straightened his back , fretted with his bridle , puckered his lips to whistle , and simply sighed .
Blank slopes on either side , with never a sign of a decent beast or tree -- much less a man .
There is a limit beyond which every man must fear .
That is where the difference comes in . ''
I was always a little afraid if I tried his patience too much he would fall on me suddenly and smother me .
I own I was weak .
But I was also annoyed with Pyecraft .
The little affair of Pattison to which I have alluded was a different matter altogether .
`` And then something shot down by me -- something heavy , and stood a-quiver in the planks .
Just about the level of the top spars of the Ocean Pioneer , whack !
It was a big weight atop of me , whatever it was , and moving and twisting about .
But octopuses don't wear boots .
It was all in a moment , of course .
A slight feeling of exhilaration , perhaps .
`` I thought , '' said Mr. Brisher , `` AND I thought .
Once I got regular doubtful whether I 'd seen it or not , and went down to it and 'ad it uncovered again , just as her ma came out to 'ang up a bit of washin' she 'd done .
Afterwards I was just thinking I 'd 'ave another go at it , when Jane comes to tell me dinner was ready .
Have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like that ? ''
The man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description .
No one knew what they might do , with excited men inside them ; few even cared to speculate .
`` And before she could speak again I began to talk , talking eloquently -- as I COULD do in that life -- talking to exalt love , to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious ; and the thing I was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside .
I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it , seeking not only to convert her but myself to that .
And at last I did make it heroic , made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love , and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last , clad in that splendid delusion , drunken rather with that glorious delusion , under the still stars .
`` But why should it be ?
If , indeed , this battle , this slaughter and stress IS life , why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty ?
If there IS no refuge , if there is no place of peace , and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare , why have we such dreams ?
Love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty , more glorious than all else in life , in the very shape and colour of life , and summoned me away .
I shouted to the officer .
For more than two hundred and fifty miles from Walcheren to Friesland stretched a line of embankments and pumping stations that was the admiration of the world .
'Not a bit of it , ' said the king .
He substituted 'ideas . '
'Those were the authentic kings .
In the end they were cut up and a bit given to everybody .
The members of the new world government dined at three long tables on trestles , and down the middle of these tables Leblanc , in spite of the barrenness of his menu , had contrived to have a great multitude of beautiful roses .
The assembly dined as it had debated , in the open air , and over the dark crags to the west the glowing June sunset shone upon the banquet .
There was no precedency now among the ninety-three , and King Egbert found himself between a pleasant little Japanese stranger in spectacles and his cousin of Central Europe , and opposite a great Bengali leader and the President of the United States of America .
Three other aeroplanes curved down and came to rest amidst grass close by the smashed machine .
The coffin-shaped box that had occupied the centre of the machine had broken , and three black objects , each with two handles like the ears of a pitcher , lay peacefully amidst the litter .
The task that lay before the Assembly of Brissago , viewed as we may view it now from the clarifying standpoint of things accomplished , was in its broad issues a simple one .
The old tendencies of human nature , suspicion , jealousy , particularism , and belligerency , were incompatible with the monstrous destructive power of the new appliances the inhuman logic of science had produced .
However tacit our understandings were in the past , with this new kind of Labour , this young , restive Labour of the twentieth century , which can read , discuss and combine , we need something in the nature of a social contract .
And it is when one comes to consider by what possible means these suspicious third-class passengers in our leaking and imperilled social liner can be brought into generous co-operation with the second and the first that one discovers just how lamentably out of date and out of order our political institutions , which should supply the means for just this inter-class discussion , have become .
With our whole social order in danger , our Legislature is busy over the trivial little affairs of the Welsh Established Church , whose endowment probably is not equal to the fortune of any one of half a dozen _Titanic_ passengers or a tithe of the probable loss of another strike among the miners .
They believe in secular change , in Progress , in a future for our species differing continually more from its past .
It needs a special gift , in addition to that knowledge , to make a man able to impart it .
Such small wealth of officers as we have -- and I am quite prepared to believe that the officers we have are among the very best in the world -- are scarcely enough to go round our present supply of private soldiers .
The London traffic problem is just one of those questions that appeal very strongly to the more prevalent and less charitable types of English mind .
It has a practical and constructive air , it deals with impressively enormous amounts of tangible property , it rests with a comforting effect of solidity upon assumptions that are at once doubtful and desirable .
It seems free from metaphysical considerations , and it has none of those disconcerting personal applications , those penetrations towards intimate qualities , that makes eugenics , for example , faintly but persistently uncomfortable .
This is the case with the orthodox Catholic and with the orthodox Positivist .
It banishes step-parents from the world .
It banishes for ever any dream of escape from the presence and service of either party , or of any separation from the children of the union .
All unsophisticated human beings appear disposed to a fierce proprietorship in their children and their sexual partners , and in no respect is the ordinary mortal so easily induced to vehemence and violence .
There is a growing discord between governments and governed in the world .
There has been a steady concentration of wealth and of the reality as distinguished from the forms of power in the hands of a small energetic minority , and a steady approximation of the condition of the mass of the citizens to that of the so-called proletariat of the European communities .
And , concurrently with the appearance of these concentrations of great wealth , we have appearing also poverty , poverty of a degree that was quite unknown in the United States for the first century of their career as an independent nation .
The real interest of America for the next century to the student of civilisation will be the development of these attempts , now in their infancy , to create and realise out of this racial hotchpotch , this human chaos , an idea , of the collective commonwealth as the datum of reference for every individual life .
`` What wo n't they say next ? ''
Socially , my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated .
But my uncle , for the most part , spent his evenings at home .
`` Oh , you !
-- YOU 'RE all right .
I kept that aspect in mind .
There 's some of it left George -- trust me !
I had grown taller , and he , I thought , had grown shorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was unchanged .
`` 'Lectricity , '' said my uncle , taking breath after a deep draught of tea .
By Jove , it must be nearly six years since we met !
`` There 's a lot of this Science about nowadays , '' Mr. Ramboat reflected ; `` but I sometimes wonder a bit what good it is ? ''
Trade rules the world .
The thing was true , and true too was my uncle 's proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle .
Perhaps my great heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men , fine now only because they are distant ; perhaps after all this Socialism to which I had been drawn was only a foolish dream , only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true .
They knew it ; every one , except a few young fools , knew it .
As I crossed the corner of St. James 's Park wrapped in thought , I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys .
`` No doubt , '' thought I , `` a pill-vendor's wife ... . ''
Do n't you care ? ''
`` I like you ! ''
I stuck to that resolution for seven long years .
`` Do you know Pampas Grass ? ''
`` I love Pampas Grass ... if there is room . ''
That life of intimate emotions is made up of little things .
Some readers will understand -- to others I shall seem no more than an unfeeling brute who could n't make allowances ... .
I felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe .
`` I suppose , '' she said , `` SHE cares for you ? ''
Our own resolve carried us on our predestined way .
We behaved more and more like separating lovers , parting inexorably , but all the preparations we had set going worked on like a machine , and we made no attempt to stop them .
And that , except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger , and the use of my name by the firm , which also annoyed me , is the end of Marion's history for me , and she vanishes out of this story .
He always went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as possible .
To the last his movements remained quick and sudden , his short firm legs , as he walked , seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissors-stride of common humanity , and he never seemed to have knees , but instead , a dispersed flexibility of limb .
Then we went on to Moggs and found him in a camel-hair dressing-jacket in a luxurious bed , drinking China tea , and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time .
`` I say , is there any black-lead in Pepys ?
Beatrice burst into cheerful laughter with her eye on me .
I was lying on the turf , and this perhaps caused a slight confusion about the primordial curse in Lady Osprey 's mind .
I want to talk . ''
And at last I could hold out no longer against these accumulating pressures .
`` You think we 're unsubstantial .
When you are with me you know I 'm a man ; when you get away from me you think I'm a cheat and a cad ... .
You do not know how wide and far we have spread our nets .
It will put us on a footing .
Still you know , George ... .
I believe in him . ''
`` I do not know dis coast , '' he used to say .
`` I cama hera because Gordon-Nasmyth was coming too .
`` He 's a Card , '' said Pollack .
`` It 's been a rum go , '' he said .
`` But '' I said , looking down at him , perplexed .
Kingdoms Caesar never knew ... .
A great poet , George .
Kingdoms Caesar never knew ... .
Under entirely new management .
To run down the Thames so is to run one 's hand over the pages in the book of England from end to end .
Behind us are Kew and Hampton Court with their memories of Kings and Cardinals , and one runs at first between Fulham 's episcopal garden parties and Hurlingham 's playground for the sporting instinct of our race .
At present the class of specially trained and capable people -- doctors , engineers , scientific men of all sorts -- is quite disproportionally absent from political life , it does not exist as a factor in that life , it is growing up outside that life , and has still to develop , much more to display , a collective intention to come specifically in .
But the forces are in active operation to drag it into the centre of the stage for all that .
The race areas , for example , which are now not traceable in Europe at all must have represented old regions of separation ; the language areas , which have little or no essential relation to racial distribution , have also given way long since to the newer forces that have united and consolidated nations .
A parallel arrest of dialectic separation has happened in France , in Italy , in Germany , and in the States .
It is simply an aspect of the general process that has arisen out of mechanical locomotion .
And clearly this process of assimilation will continue .
Even local differences of accent seem likely to follow .
The first chapter in the history of this intellectual development , its definite and formal opening , coincides with the opening of the nineteenth century and the publication of Malthus 's _Essay on Population_ .
She will be round the corner in a minute .
`` May I ask to whom I am indebted ? ''
He was getting winded .
He turned the corner and saw a long stretch of road , and a grey dress vanishing .
All his physiology began to cry out at him .
His front wheel suddenly shrieked aloud .
`` Because I 'm a damned fool , sir .
But I ca n't .
And I do n't want to go a bit .
WHY should a man rush about like a rocket , all pace and fizzle ?
It makes me furious .
A quiet , dignified , philosophical man , that 's what I am -- at bottom ; and here I am dancing with rage and swearing like a drunken tinker at a perfect stranger --
And having lit a cigarette , the other man in brown returned to the business in hand .
`` You have said all that before .
Do you think that justifies you ? ''
I really beg your pardon .
`` P'raps they 'll come presently .
But he had it ready .
`` _I_ should have screamed and run away . ''
`` Something I 've forgotten .
In his heart he was raving at his idiotic folly at thus bearding these lions , -- indisputably they WERE lions , -- but he had to go through with it now .
He fixed his eye on the face of the fat man with the chins , and spoke in a low , impressive voice .
`` I came here , sir , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver , and paused to inflate his cheeks , `` with a lady . ''
`` Some dirty cad , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver , proceeding with his discourse , and suddenly growing extremely fierce , `` made a remark as we went by this door . ''
`` A draper 's assistant is n't a position to be ashamed of , '' she said , recovering , and not quite understanding yet what this all meant .
`` It 's never -- ''
It is easy to see , therefore , how it came about that the inorganic sciences were regarded as the true scientific bed-rock .
Comte and Herbert Spencer certainly seem to me to have taken that much for granted .
I seem to be a consciousness , vague and insecure , placed between two worlds .
One of these worlds seems clearly `` not me , '' the other is more closely identified with me and yet is still imperfectly me .
In a certain way I seem able to interfere with it and control it .
The second is the interior world , having no forms in space and only a vague evasive reference to time , from which motives arise and storms of emotion , which acts and reacts constantly and in untraceable way with my conscious mind .
And that consciousness itself hangs and drifts about the region where the inner world and the outer world meet , much as a patch of limelight drifts about the stage , illuminating , affecting , following no manifest law except that usually it centres upon the hero , my Ego .
It is a fact I record about myself without aggression or regret .
But the virtue is in what he gets done and not in what he does not do .
Then he must needs adopt heroic abstinence , and even more so must he take to preventive restraint if he sees any motive becoming unruly and urgent and troublesome .
Many who have sensitive imaginations nowadays very properly abstain from meat because of butchery .
Now it seems to me that the Believer must also be a Lover , that he will love as much as he can and as many people as he can , and in many moods and ways .
They have been , to put it by a figure , urgent upon the road to the ocean .
But all streams , all rivers come from this ocean in the beginning , lead to it in the end .
Failing a full return , it makes the most of an inadequate return .
But it seeks a full return , and the fulness of life has come only to those who , loving , have met the lover .
But interspersed with the memories of this grey routine were certain patches of brilliant colour -- the holidays , his holidays , which in spite of the feud between their seniors , he spent as much as possible with Sid Pornick , the son of the irascible black-bearded haberdasher next door .
They seemed to be memories of a different world .
There were glorious days of `` mucking about '' along the beach , the siege of unresisting Martello towers , the incessant interest of the mystery and motion of windmills , the windy excursions with boarded feet over the yielding shingle to Dungeness lighthouse -- Sid Pornick and he far adrift from reality , smugglers and armed men from the moment they left Great Stone behind them -- wanderings in the hedgeless reedy marsh , long excursions reaching even to Hythe , where the machine guns of the Empire are forever whirling and tapping , and to Rye and Winchelsea , perched like dream-cities on their little hills .
`` You got a girl ? ''
asked Sid , spitting very cleverly again .
`` Oh , you keep half and I keep half , and when we 're sep'rated you look at your half and I look at mine -- see !
They look meaningly at one another .
( Carshot and Buggins were n't in it with them . )
`` At least -- presently . ''
`` That 's nothing , '' said Chitterlow , with an air of experience that was extremely convincing .
There 's any amount of money , an-ny amount , in a good play . ''
`` Tha 's dam ' fine , '' said the new dramatic critic , quite familiar with his part now , striking the table with his fist and almost upsetting his third portion ( in the second series ) of old Methusaleh .
`` Tha 's dam ' fine , Chit'low ! ''
And he would never see her again -- never !
I know you , '' and the old gentleman coughed shortly and nodded to the horizon and coughed again .
The new girl in the cash desk had had it from Pierce and had dashed out into the fancy shop to be the first with the news on the fancy side .
Kipps had been left a thousand pounds a year , twelve thousand pounds a year .
Kipps had been left twelve hundred thousand pounds .
Kipps had gone upstairs .
It was said that he was singing ribaldry about old Shalford .
`` I 'm sure we all congratulate him , '' said Miss Mergle .
Everyone , it seemed , was saying how glad they were it was Kipps , except the junior apprentice , upon whom -- he being the only son of a widow and used to having the best of everything as a right -- an intolerable envy , a sense of unbearable wrong , had cast its gloomy shade .
Ut 's the loveliest country in the world .
An ' pretty gals !
The living room door opened quickly , showing a table equipped with elaborate simplicity for supper , and Mrs. Kipps appeared .
Kipps perceived his opportunity .
He passes on towards the Public Library , lifts the envelope in salutation to a passing curate , smiles and enters ... .
He had known -- in fact Buggins and Carshot and Pierce had made it very clear indeed -- that his status in life had changed and that stupendous adaptations had to be achieved , but how they were to be effected had driven that adaptation into the incredible .
Not of course easy , but possible .
`` Oo yes , '' said Kipps .
`` Silly like , '' he said .
`` She 's splendid , '' said Coote , coming to it abruptly .
They discussed stage illusion .
`` But most plays are written for the stage , '' said Helen , looking at the sugar .
Sid stood motionless for a space , unheeding some further remark from old Kipps .
She took him in hand in perfect good faith .
She told him things about his accent , she told him things about his bearing , about his costume and his way of looking at things .
He sought very diligently to anticipate some at least of these informing thrusts by making great use of Coote .
`` Wait for the lean years , '' he cried .
`` Wait for the lean years . ''
And suddenly he fell into a struggle with his cough and spat a gout of blood .
`` A half bottle ? ''
Everyone was n't so rich as he was .
`` Everything , '' said Masterman .
They spent the days before their marriage in a number of agreeable excursions together .
She was glad there were none in this country .
They meditated upon replicas of classical statuary without excessive comment .
But the place at that early hour was really lonely .
So they went out into the October sunshine of the mighty terraces , and wandered amidst miles of stucco tanks and about those quiet Gargantuan grounds .
`` It 's rum , '' said Kipps .
`` Do n't you see it ? ''
'Ave a segar ? ''
When he got outside the house everything looked so wet under the drive of the southwester that he abandoned the prospect of the clay lanes towards Newington altogether , and turned east to Folkestone along the Seabrook digue .
And there was Kipps in his mackintosh and squeaky leggings , looking like a fool !
Presently he came upon a resolve .
It keeps on going 'round and 'round in my 'ead , and 'round and 'round .
I shall keep on thinking 'ow I might 'ave stopped it and callin ' myself a fool .
`` Something to tell you , '' said Kipps ; `` something noo ! ''
`` I thought of it one day when I was in Folkestone .
I see a chap dressin ' a window and he was whistlin ' reg'lar light-'arted ... .
It wouldn't be 'arf bad .
Charles Scribner 's Sons , New York
He seemed interested in this .
It 's ten years ago .
I think Montgomery might have left him then , seeing the brute was drunk ; but he only turned a shade paler , and followed the captain to the bulwarks .
I turned , standing waist deep , and stared at them .
Montgomery stood panting at the margin of the water .
His face was bright-red with exertion , his long flaxen hair blown about his head , and his dropping nether lip showed his irregular teeth .
Moreau was just coming up , his face pale and firm , and the dog at his hand barked at me .
Both men had heavy whips .
`` They were men , men like yourselves , whom you have infected with some bestial taint , -- men whom you have enslaved , and whom you still fear .
`` Blood on the sleeve , '' said he , and rolled back the flannel .
The imperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread .
I felt too faint and weary to insist , and I let the moment pass .
This , I say , was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these brutes .
It was about May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference in their speech and carriage , a growing coarseness of articulation , a growing disinclination to talk .
They held things more clumsily ; drinking by suction , feeding by gnawing , grew commoner every day .
They were reverting , and reverting very rapidly .
He thought Buster Brown the one drop of paraffin in the otherwise delicious feast of the Sunday Supplement .
But he was a diplomatic child .
The party became a circle .
`` You see , '' said Lady Frensham ; `` it _will_ be civil war !
And yet you writing people who have influence do nothing to prevent it ! ''
Beyond the village Mr. Britling seemed to gather confidence .
For God demands more from us than mere righteousness .
`` Unless you broke an axle or burst a tyre , '' said Mr. Direck .
The world has no need to reckon with them .
Mr. Britling in these moods did not perhaps experience the grey and hopeless desolations of the melancholic nor the red damnation of the choleric , but he saw a world that bristled with misfortune and error , with poisonous thorns and traps and swampy places and incurable blunderings .
An almost insupportable remorse for being Mr. Britling would pursue him -- justifying itself upon a hundred counts ... .
It was a characteristic of these moods of Mr. Britling that they produced a physical restlessness .
`` You do n't dislike me or despise me ? ''
`` It 's the chances of war , '' said Mr. Britling .
`` We may have to get along with that for an indefinite time . ''
`` I suppose they are to be got , '' said Mr. Britling .
Still -- the idea of Zeppelins over London did seem rather ridiculous to Mr. Britling .
There never had been Zeppelins over London .
They were gas bags ... .
On Wednesday morning Mr. Britling returned to the Dower House , and he was still a civilian unassigned .
The battle of the Marne passed into the battle of the Aisne , and then the long lines of the struggle streamed north-westward until the British were back in Belgium failing to clutch Menin and then defending Ypres .
These are the things that happen in histories and stories .
Abruptly and shockingly , this malignity of warfare , which had been so far only a festering cluster of reports and stories and rumours and suspicions , stretched out its arm into Essex and struck a barb of grotesque cruelty into the very heart of Mr. Britling .
Late one afternoon came a telegram from Filmington-on-Sea , where Aunt Wilshire had been recovering her temper in a boarding-house after a round of visits in Yorkshire and the moorlands .
And she had been `` very seriously injured '' by an overnight German air raid .
`` His arm is withered ; his son -- imbecile .
`` Half our men are educated men , reasonably educated , but we are always being treated as though we were too stupid for words ... .
We work pretty hard .

Bad blisters disable a man .
Of the million of surplus women ( see above ) the government has not had the intelligence to get any to darn our socks .
So a certain percentage of us go lame .
A subsequent letter threw fresh light on the career of the young man with the `` oto . ''
Before the rifle and the `` oto , '' and in spite of his fights with some person or persons unknown , Ortheris found trouble .
`` One in three or four in the very hottest corners . ''
`` With life generally .
Everybody believes in him .
Do you remember how Manning used to hide from him ?
Mr. Britling read this through , and then his thoughts went back to Teddy 's disappearance and then returned to Hugh .
But he found he had to begin the lesson of stoicism all over again .
`` Is it really -- honest ? ''
Suddenly the real woman cried out from her .
`` For me it came all at once , without a doubt or a hope .
I hoped until the last that nothing would touch Hugh .
`` You do n't mind if I talk like this ? ''
`` Religion is the first thing and the last thing , and until a man has found God and been found by God , he begins at no beginning , he works to no end .
He is the only King ... .
Across the fields a line of gaunt iron standards , abominably designed , carried an electric cable to some unknown end .
The curve of the hill made them seem a little out of the straight , as if they hurried and bent forward furtively .
`` Mother says that . ''
She stopped short at questionings , for the thing was said .
It spoke of her once as `` Norah , '' and once as `` the Scrope Flapper . ''
And the door she opened thus carelessly gave upon a stormy background like one of the stormy backgrounds that were popular behind portrait Dianas in eighteenth century paintings .
He began to make interminable weak plans for fulfilling his duty to his diocese and his daughter .
The Morrice Deans enquiry however demanded an amount of erudition that greatly fatigued the bishop .
He had a very fair general knowledge of vestments , but he had never really cared for anything but the poetry of ornaments , and he had to work strenuously to master the legal side of the question .
The bishop wanted to end the matter as quickly , quietly , and favourably to Morrice Deans as possible ; he thought Morrice Deans a thoroughly good man in his parish , and he believed that the substitution of a low churchman would mean a very complete collapse of church influence in Mogham Banks , where people were now thoroughly accustomed to a highly ornate service .
But Morrice Deans was intractable and his pursuers indefatigable , and on several occasions the bishop sat far into the night devising compromises and equivocations that should make the Kensitites think that Morrice Deans was n't wearing vestments when he was , and that should make Morrice Deans think he was wearing vestments when he was n't .
And it was Whippham who first suggested green tea as a substitute for coffee , which gave the bishop indigestion , as his stimulant for these nocturnal bouts .
Bishops and divines who were patriots one heard discordantly enough , but where were the bishops and divines who spoke for the Prince of Peace ?
We say the creeds ; how far may we unsay them ?
`` He , '' said Dr. Dale , `` would certainly set about trying to restore your old sphere of illusion , your old familiar sensations and ideas and confidences .
He would in fact turn you back .
He would restore all your habits .
He would forbid you newspapers and order you to botanize and prescribe tranquillizing reading ; Trollope's novels , the Life of Gladstone , the works of Mr. A. C. Benson , memoirs and so on .
And we 'd wash out the effects of the Princhester water with Contrexeville , and afterwards put you on Salutaris or Perrier .
At last he had to stop altogether and kneel down and fumble with the last obstinate button .
But he was still wearing the uniform of a priest in the service of those three creeds .
`` Your spirituality seems as thin as a mist .
Where 's Hell now ?
The spirit that denies .
You would n't do anything .
Only you would be lost in the outer wilderness .
The old man opened out fresh aspects of the case .
His argument was for delay , for deliberation .
He went on to a wider set of considerations .
He has become an official part of a great edifice which supports the faith of multitudes of simple and dependant believers .
He will just break away their supports , astonish them , puzzle them , distress them , deprive them of confidence , convince them of nothing .
He rolled back again and lay staring .
He was afraid of that greatness .
He was afraid of the great imperatives that he knew would at once take hold of his life .
His presence became more definite , and the earthly globe about them and the sun and the stars grew less distinct and less immediately there .
The bishop : `` Blessed be the name of the Lord . ''
And there we must set up your tabernacle , a very plain , very simple , very beautifully proportioned building in which you can give your message .
I know a young man , just the very young man to do something of the sort , something quite new , quite modern , and yet solemn and serious .
My imagination and my desire is running away with me .
It is no time yet for premature plans .
And not only pray you .
Take me , I demand of you , in the name of God our king .
I have a right to be used .
Let men but see God simply , and forthwith God and his kingdom possess the world . ''
Very golden , like a warm-tinted Chablis .
It was almost impossible to think of a church built upon other lines than that .
But he was still haunted by a dread of preaching in his own family .
He was sitting over the snoring gas fire in his study .
He did not want to go to bed .
In the last twelve hours , since he had gone out across the park to his momentous talk with Lady Sunderbund , it seemed to him that his life had passed through its cardinal crisis and come to its crown and decision .
He was established now in the sure conviction of God 's reality , and of his advent to unify the lives of men and to save mankind .
That made Parload put down the opera-glass and look at me .
Her father answered indistinctly from the parlor , and a chair creaked .
I judged he was disturbed in his nap .
The fight had begun .
-- I took the revolver because I had the revolver and was a foolish young lout .
I have gone somewhere safe , and with some one who cares for me very much .
I am sorry for your sakes , but it seems that it had to be .
I am very , very happy ( deeply underlined ) .
My chance of escape had gone .
He could not argue with me while so important a person engaged him .
I came boldly down the steps .
What a world it was !
I stopped and looked back more attentively at that wide ugly valley .
The green clouds would whirl and vanish , and there might be thunderstorms .
But through the attenuated wisps of comet shine , the old sky , the old stars , would reappear , and all would be as it had been before .
Perhaps , if it came late , one would see no more than a shooting star low down in the sky .
All this we had with the utmost assurances of science .
Still it did not prevent the last nights being the most beautiful and memorable of human experiences .
I sought them in vain the next morning , but after midday I came in quick succession on a perplexing multitude of clues .
After failing to find any young couple that corresponded to young Verrall and Nettie , I presently discovered an unsatisfactory quartette of couples .
They 're fighting -- not five miles from shore . ''
I recalled the last phases of my former life , that darkling climax of pursuit and anger and universal darkness and the whirling green vapors of extinction .
The comet had struck the earth and made an end to all things ; of that too I was assured .
Let me try to give the chief things that had vanished from their minds .
The community which lived upon the land was supposed to have waived its necessary connection with the land , except in certain limited instances of highway and common .
They owned the land almost as a man now owns his hat ; they bought it and sold it , and cut it up like cheese or ham ; they were free to ruin it , or leave it waste , or erect upon it horrible and devastating eyesores .
They had practically no relations and no duties to the nominal , municipal , or national Government amidst whose larger areas their own dominions lay .
Was there coal , was there petroleum or gold , was there rich soil or harborage , or the site for a fine city , these obsessed and witless Governments cried out for scramblers , and a stream of shabby , tricky , and violent adventurers set out to found a new section of the landed aristocracy of the world .
After a brief century of hope and pride , the great republic of the United States of America , the hope as it was deemed of mankind , became for the most part a drifting crowd of landless men ; landlords and railway lords , food lords ( for the land is food ) and mineral lords ruled its life , gave it Universities as one gave coins to a mendicant , and spent its resources upon such vain , tawdry , and foolish luxuries as the world had never seen before .
Here was a thing none of these statesmen before the Change would have regarded as anything but the natural order of the world , which not one of them now regarded as anything but the mad and vanished illusion of a period of dementia .
Time was when these platitudes had the freshness and wonder of a gospel .
She comes back , and Verrall is in her company .
The glass made them seem curved , and it enhanced and altered their gestures and paces .
At the sight of me they stopped short , and Verrall cried with the note of one who has sought , `` Here he is ! ''
I did not know how short that time would be , but the little I could do -- perhaps after all it was not little to her -- to atone for the harshness of my days of wrath and rebellion , I did .
It was not that we had ideas to exchange or pleasures to share , but she liked to see me at table , to watch me working , to have me go to and fro .
At that time my attention was much engaged by the stir of the great Beltane festival that was held on May-day in the Year of Scaffolding .
It was inevitable that the old idea of purification should revive with the name , it was felt to be a burning of other than material encumbrances , innumerable quasi-spiritual things , deeds , documents , debts , vindictive records , went up on those great flares .
You may think that this is a story of disillusionment .
When I first heard the story , I thought so too .
He said how anxious he felt for her health , called her his `` Dainty Little Lady , '' and spoke of the coarseness of other women .
Perhaps you will understand .
Clean , cold , and correct this is , speaking of orderly affection , settled and stereotyped long ago .
Is it not immediately infinitely more soft and tender ?
Is there not something exquisitely pleasant in lingering over those redundant letters , leaving each word , as it were , with a reluctant caress ?
Industrious , rather than intelligent , people have given not a little time , and such minds as they have , to the discussion of the right spelling of our great poet 's name .
But he himself never dreamt of tying himself down to one presentation of himself , and was -- we have his hand for it -- Shakespeare , Shakspear , Shakespear , Shakspeare , and so forth , as the mood might be .
`` In moderation , '' said Bagarrow , opening out to questions on that matter , `` social relaxation is desirable , and I will even go so far as to admit that I think it well to have at hand some pleasant expedient for entertaining people and passing the time .
That incident , indeed , gives you the very essence of Bagarrow in his insidious attacks on evil .
But he did not say `` My benefactor , '' at anyrate , though he fell upon him , cheerfully enough .
It is possible that an education entirely urban is not the best conceivable preparation for descriptive articles upon the country .
On the other hand , your professional nature-lover is sometimes a little over-familiar with his subject .
He knows the names of all the things , and he does not spare you .
Besides , he is subtle .
The prominent features are too familiar to him , and he goes into details .
No Englishman can tell any tree from any other tree , except a very palpable oak or poplar .
So that we may at least , as an experiment , allow a good Londoner to take his unsophisticated eyes out into the sweet country for once , and try his skill at nature-loving , though his botany has been learned over the counter of flower-shops , and his zoology on Saturday afternoons when they have the band in the Gardens .
And the burthen of his song is of course the autumn tints .
Looking down from the observatory one can see the pathways across the park dotted out in yellow lamps , each with a fringe of dim green ; and further off , hot and bright , is the tracery of the illuminated streets , through which the people go to and fro .
Save for an occasional stirring , or a passing voice speaking out of the dimness beneath me , the night is very still .
We five had all been playmates together .
She seems tremendously grown-up and womanly to me .
My attention is constantly being distracted to note how prettily she moves , to wonder why it is I never noticed the sweet fall , the faint delightful whisper of a lisp in her voice before .
`` But is that All you want ? ''
I have the minutest recollection of the misty bloom upon the turf , and the ragged , filmy carpet of gossamer on either hand , of the warm wetness of every little blade and blossom and of the little scraps and seeds of grass upon my soaking and discolored boots .
All the little things upon the ground , fallen branches , tussocks , wood-piles , have a peculiar intensity and importance , seem magnified , because of the length of their shadows in the slanting rays , and all the great trees seem lifted above the light and merged with the sky .
We each hold out both our hands and clasp and hesitate and rather shyly kiss .
love me , my Stephen , love me , dear .
For a long time we lay close in one another 's arms upon a bank of thyme .
And it seemed to me that nothing that had ever happened or could happen afterwards , mattered against that happiness ... .
So we talked in fragments and snatches of argument , and all she said made me see more clearly the large hopelessness of my desire .
`` At least , '' I urged , `` do not marry Justin now .
My father shut one eye and regarded the color of his port against the waning light .
-- quoting the _Germans_ !
German silver and Electroplated Empires ... .
`` It 's just a part of our narrow outlook , '' I answered from the hearthrug , after a pause .
I have a vivid sense of declaring not once only but several times that Mary and I were husband and wife `` in the sight of God . ''
I must have spoken to Justin at times as if he had come merely to confirm my view of the long dispute there had been between us .
I remember my confused sense that presently she and I would have to go straight out of Martens .
Justin , I remember , still talking , closed the door .
I tried to think how I could get to the station five miles away , and then what we could do in London .
We should seem rather odd visitors to an hotel -- without luggage .
All this was behind my valiant demand that she should come with me , and come now .
Mary 's letters were neither of them very long , and full of a new-born despair .
We had to agree not to meet or communicate for three years , and I was to go out of England .
She prayed me to accept this .
Justin had been generous , in his way ... .
One sees that enslavement to labor progressing from crude directness to the most subtly indirect methods .
But the larger part of our modern slavery is past the stage of brand and whip .
Instead of flicking the whip , we groan at last with Harriet Martineau at the inexorable laws of political economy that condemn us to comfort and direction , and those others to toil and hardship and indignity ... .
`` We tore her to pieces , '' he repeated .
Her face lit with a smile , and Mr. Lewisham 's relaxed in sympathy .
But never had the extraordinary advantages of open-air study presented themselves so vividly .
Before breakfast he took half an hour of open-air reading along the allotments lane near the Frobishers ' house , after breakfast and before school he went through the avenue with a book , and returned from school to his lodgings circuitously through the avenue , and so back to the avenue for thirty minutes or so before afternoon school .
`` Smith , '' said Lewisham , a little hastily , and repenting the lie even as it left his lips .
He considered the limits of frankness .
He heard someone going by in the lane behind him .
He would not look round -- it annoyed him to think of people seeing him in this position .
`` It 's perfectly splendid .
Of all the fine weather the best has been kept for now .
My very last day . ''
( Surveying him , Madam , your eye would inevitably have fallen to his collar -- curiously shiny , a surface like wet gum .
Although it has practically nothing to do with this story , I must , I know , dispose of that before I go on , or you will be inattentive .
In that now half-forgotten love affair at Whortley even , he had , in spite of the considerable degree of intimacy attained , said absolutely nothing about his Career .
he said , calling down the narrow laboratory and following his voice .
He spoke with the ghost of a lisp .
I hope I do n't intrude .
Excuse me , sir .
The room was lined with bookshelves , and conspicuous therein were a long row of foolish pretentious volumes , the `` works '' of Lagune -- the witless , meandering imitation of philosophy that occupied his life .
A pen , flung down forcibly , quivered erect with its one surviving nib in the blotting pad .
They came to the end of the road in silence .
Then at the kerb corner she turned and faced him .
A moment 's pause .
`` Good-bye , '' he said as though he was snapping a thread that held them together .
The arrangement had not been effected without friction , the explanation had proved difficult .
Evidently she did not appreciate the full seriousness of Lewisham 's mediocre position in the list .
Neither could she grasp the importance of evening study .
She calculated the time consumed by their walk as half an hour , `` just one half hour ; '' she forgot that he had to get to Chelsea and then to return to his lodgings .
`` But here we are at your diggings . ''
`` Oh , _damn_ Miss Heydinger ! ''
said Lewisham , and suddenly , abruptly , uncivilly , he turned away from Parkson at the end of the street and began walking away southward , leaving Parkson in mid-sentence at the crossing .
You must come out of your cheating , and I must come out of my ... cramming .
And we -- we must marry . ''
`` And now you have raised the matter , I am bound to say -- ''
`` _I_ do n't find life simple , '' said Lewisham , `` but I do think there 's a Right and a Wrong in things .
He spent five shillings in stamps on the way .
`` It 's what 's understood by it in _this_ country , '' said Blendershin .
Then there 's shorthand -- ''
And suddenly came a florist 's window , and in the centre of it a glorious heap of roses .
`` Go on , '' said Lewisham , with the debating-society taste for a thesis prevailing for a minute over that matter of the roses .
`` My bankers ! ''
But the thing that is merely proposed , the thing that is merely suggested , however rational , however necessary , seems strange and inhuman in its clear , hard , uncompromising lines , its unqualified angles and surfaces .
And with this loosening of the fetters of locality from the feet of men , necessarily there will be all sorts of fresh distributions of the factors of life .
People would pass us in the twilight , and then more people ; we should see they walked well and wore a graceful , unfamiliar dress , but more we should not distinguish .
Two lovers pass us whispering , and we follow them with our eyes .
This Utopia has certainly preserved the fundamental freedom , to love .
`` That 's all very well in a novel , '' he says .
She is not the sort of woman ... .
Do n't think I do n't feel ... .
`` You did one too ! ''
He goes on before I can say anything more .
Now such an arrangement is merely the completed induction from the starting propositions that make some measure of education free and compulsory for every child in the State .
I try to explain that a phase in the world 's development is inevitable when a systematic world-wide attempt will be made to destroy for ever a great number of contagious and infectious diseases , and that this will involve , for a time at any rate , a stringent suppression of the free movement of familiar animals .
Utopian houses , streets and drains will be planned and built to make rats , mice , and such-like house parasites impossible ; the race of cats and dogs -- providing , as it does , living fastnesses to which such diseases as plague , influenza , catarrhs and the like , can retreat to sally forth again -- must pass for a time out of freedom , and the filth made by horses and the other brutes of the highway vanish from the face of the earth .
Surely they would tend to counteract the severity of costume the Rule dictates . ''
I went threading my way among gorges and precipices , with my poor brain dreaming of what the alternative should be , with my imagination straining and failing .
Now did I say anything of the sort ?
He and I stand up quickly , I as soon as he .
But now the full meaning of the group has reached me .
`` He 's not a scoundrel here .
Whatever troubled them there -- -- ''
Each generation will have its new version of Utopia , a little more certain and complete and real , with its problems lying closer and closer to the problems of the Thing in Being .
One 's political proceedings , one 's moral acts are , I hold , just as much self-expression as one 's poetry or painting or music .
But since life has for its primordial elements assimilation and aggression , I try not only to obey my imperatives , but to put them persuasively and convincingly into other minds , to bring about _my_ good and to resist and overcome _my_ evil as though they were the universal Good and the universal Evil in which unthinking men believe .
And it is obviously in no way contradictory to this philosophy , for me , if I find others responding sympathetically to any notes of mine or if I find myself responding sympathetically to notes sounding about me , to give that common resemblance between myself and others a name , to refer these others and myself in common to this thing as if it were externalised and spanned us all .
`` Is it new to you ? ''
`` You do n't ... '' began the Vicar , falteringly .
`` The painted creature in light attire -- disgustingly light attire , to speak freely -- with whom you were promenading the garden . ''
I really do n't see how we are to persuade people .
Temporarily at least I think it would be best of you to do as you propose to do , and behave as a man as far as possible .
You have so far enlarged my imagination .
All these years I have been forgetting Wonderland .
The drunken man stood swaying for a moment , then he made an unsteady snatch at his hat and threw it down at the Angel's feet .
The Angel said it had no name , and Mrs Jehoram thought music ought never to have any names and wanted to know who it was by , and when the Angel told her he played it out of his head , she said he must be Quite a Genius and looked open ( and indisputably fascinating ) admiration at him .
`` Did you really make that up yourself ? ''
`` Thank you , '' said the Vicar , `` I 'm obliged to you .
I 'm really obliged to you . ''
said the Vicar , suddenly starting up and appealing to the inexorable fates .
But he wore once more the saffron robe in the place of his formless overcoat .
He began taking short runs , flapping his wings and leaping , going to and fro amidst the drifting patches of light and the shadows of the trees .
Delia watched him in amazement .
The Angel did not return to lunch .
Doubtless he had excellent reasons , though , for his absence .
`` I 'm a jolly good mind to have spring guns and man-traps put in this preserve .
Confound the Law ! ''
Well , that brings us face to face with two comparatively new facts that throw a shadow upon both that predominance and upon that invulnerability .
One is air transport ; the other the submarine .
They will be familiar to everyone who followed the later phases of the Great War .
Their teachers had to travel slowly and dangerously .
People were gathered together to hear with great difficulty , except in a few crowded towns .
And except for a very few people there were no schools .
Most of the tests that we apply to a state or a city or a period or a nation resolve themselves , you will find , into these questions : --
The History and Geography I had was perhaps , in one respect , the next best thing to a good course .
I have said that a disregard of the possibilities of wide organization and its associated economy of effort is characteristic of most `` advanced '' educational literature .
You will find that these places , often very picturesque and pleasing-looking places , are rarely prosperous enough to maintain more than one or two good teachers .
The rest of the staff shrinks from scrutiny .
As well might a busy man hope to array himself , by his own efforts , with hats , suits and boots made by himself out of wool and raw hides .

Mr. WELLS has also written the following novels :

`` It is brighter ! ''
But in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another .
The tangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places , and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire .
It was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her , and in a little while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs .
It was a drove of lean grisly wild swine .
In the cave conversation languished during that afternoon .
Afterwards he went and sat just within the mouth of the cave , blinking out at the afternoon sun with his uninjured eye , and thinking .
`` _I_ ca n't understand why you let go , '' said the she-bear .
Then she went back incredulously to Andoo to make one last effort to rouse him .
Yet the next day in the morning , as the horses were grazing , one of the mares whinnied , and they saw Ugh-lomi coming up the wind .
He had stuck three fern-fronds into the mat of his hair , giving him a remarkable appearance , and he walked very slowly .
`` Is it not so , my lord ? ''
The old woman had more words than any in the tribe .
And her talk was a terrible thing to hear .
Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently , and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of thoughts .
But she conveyed to Eudena , nevertheless , much of the things that were yet to come , of the Lion and of the torment he would do her .
`` Tell her , '' said the old woman .
Two days passed and they were near starving , when the tribe slew a horse .
His tomb was of marble , and , without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription , quietly imposing -- such being the fashion of his time .
`` Tripped coming down from the flying-machine from Paris -- and fell into his arms .
For a time these two Labour Serfs were kept at their original occupations , she at her brass stamping and Denton at his press ; and then came a move for him that brought with it fresh and still bitterer experiences of life in the underways of the great city .
The man who had addressed him stared , scowled , and turned away .
He made his apology straight and clean .
He scrambled up and walked to Blunt .
I have thought it all out , I have done nothing but think night and day .
I can not endure this life ... .
I can not endure it . ''
`` It has been chance , '' he said , `` it has been luck .
We have come through .
Let us test your powers , for instance .
If they really _are_ ...
The odd-job man was coming up the garden , amazed at the smashing of glass , and saw her emerge , hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands .
A day or two after this Bailey had a brilliant morning .
`` Oh , there ! ''
How he is invulnerable -- how he can jump over elephants -- how he can fly .
Said he often saw you by moonlight hovering over the crests out towards the Shendu country.
`` I 'm not a Xenophon to spin much of a yarn about my retreating army .
We had to pull the enemy up twice in the next two miles when he became a bit pressing , by exchanging shots with him , but it was a fairly monotonous affair -- hard breathing chiefly -- until we got near the place where the hills run in towards the river and pinch the valley into a gorge .
And there we very luckily caught a glimpse of half a dozen round black heads coming slanting-ways over the hill to the left of us -- the east that is -- and almost parallel with us .
We looked into one another 's eyes .
Still , a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds .
Wade repeated it very patiently .
`` Yes , '' said he .
Now my eyes are shut I know you 're right .
I 'm in England again .
The vegetation was thick by the river bank .
Great plants , as yet unnamed , grew among the roots of the big trees , and spread rosettes of huge green fans towards the strip of sky .
