`` My dear Mr. Bennet , '' said his lady to him one day , `` have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ''
`` But it is , '' returned she ; `` for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ''
Mr. Bennet made no answer .
This was invitation enough .
`` Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ''
`` But consider your daughters .
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not . ''
`` You are over-scrupulous , surely .
You take delight in vexing me .
They are my old friends .
`` Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ''
`` Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ''
Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley .
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it .
It was then disclosed in the following manner .
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with : `` I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ''
`` I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing .
`` No more have I , '' said Mr. Bennet ; `` and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ''
`` Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake !
`` When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? ''
`` Aye , so it is , '' cried her mother , `` and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ''
`` Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ''
`` I honour your circumspection .
One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .
The girls stared at their father .
I can not quite agree with you _there_ .
For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . ''
`` I am sick of Mr. Bingley , '' cried his wife .
If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him .
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies , but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London -- his five sisters and a cousin .
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .
Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .
His character was decided .
You never see a fault in anybody .
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life . ''
`` Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ?
Mr. Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ?
`` I believe , ma'am , I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him . ''
`` That is very true , '' replied Elizabeth , `` and I could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ . ''
`` Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , '' said Mrs. Bennet ; `` and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . ''
`` I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . ''
`` It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . ''
`` You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion .
I was never more annoyed !
My mind was more agreeably engaged .
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . ''
`` I am astonished , my dear , '' said Mrs. Bennet , `` that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .
`` Can I have the carriage ? ''
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .
She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ''
`` Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , '' said Darcy , `` has too much truth .
I can not boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . ''
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . ''
And yet , upon my honour , I believe what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .
Put them next to your great-uncle the judge .
They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines .
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself .
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother 's conversation with Miss Bennet .
`` Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr .
`` It is _not_ Mr. Bingley , '' said her husband ; `` it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ''
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .
This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
`` Good heavens ! ''
cried Elizabeth ; `` but how could _that_ be ?
How could his will be disregarded ?
Why did you not seek legal redress ? ''
`` There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
Family pride , and _filial_ pride -- for he is very proud of what his father was -- have done this .
`` Lady Catherine de Bourgh , '' she replied , `` has very lately given him a living .
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield , and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , `` I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
`` An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .
Jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
The possibility of Mr. Collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out :
`` You must be surprised , very much surprised -- so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you .
But when you have had time to think it over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr. Collins's character , connection , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ''
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ''
Stop me whilst you can . ''
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .
They are all for what they can get .
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . ''
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .
`` My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me .
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .
I can not understand it .
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
`` Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
`` I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ''
It is nearly fifty miles . ''
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
`` Are you indeed ?
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
-- her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
When she thought of her mother , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister .
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
`` But if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer .
Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ''
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough .
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , `` I have never known a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . ''
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character , but said nothing .
Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece .
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .
where , where is my uncle ? ''
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant , and Mr. Darcy appeared .
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment , on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . ''
Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress !
`` In the first place , '' replied Mr. Gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ''
but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption !
Why any fear of detection ?
And what claims has Lydia -- what attraction has she beyond youth , health , and good humour that could make him , for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
They travelled as expeditiously as possible , and , sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day .
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ; and , when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law 's entreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
`` Oh , papa , what news -- what news ?
Jane now came up .
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children .
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement .
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother 's hands , Lydia 's expenses had been very little within that sum .
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
There was no want of discourse .
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
`` Lizzy , I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , I believe .
`` They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
`` That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well .
`` Oh , lord !
Not these two or three years , perhaps . ''
`` If he wants our society , let him seek it .
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . ''
`` Could I expect it to be otherwise ! ''
`` Mrs. Annesley is with her .
She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .
`` Next time you call , '' said she , `` I hope we shall be more lucky . ''
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
`` Where is your sister ? ''
said he hastily , as he opened the door .
`` You are a good girl ; '' he replied , `` and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth ,
That lady , I suppose , is your mother . ''
`` Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam .
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
`` Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him .
`` Whatever my connections may be , '' said Elizabeth , `` if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ . ''
You deserve no such attention .
Pray read on . ''
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .
But your _family_ owe me nothing .
`` What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?
`` I knew , '' said he , `` that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ''
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
Painful recollections will intrude which can not , which ought not , to be repelled .
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
What do I not owe you !
By you , I was properly humbled .
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ''
`` Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
Nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? ''
I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense .
A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . ''
No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.
For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed .
The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own .
Now was the time when her son-in-law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled .
A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind .
It had not been built many years and was in good repair .
In comparison of Norland , it was poor and small indeed !
-- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away .
But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased .
`` Perhaps , '' said Elinor , `` thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together .
Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home .
`` Well , then , when will you come back again ? ''
`` I am afraid , none at all . ''
`` Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . ''
`` Come Colonel , '' said Mrs. Jennings , `` before you go , do let us know what you are going about . ''
She wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all .
Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all , than Willoughby 's behaviour .
cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered -- '' is she ill ? ''
`` My engagements at present , '' replied Willoughby , confusedly , `` are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself '' --
Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned .
`` I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me .
But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed .
Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence .
Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict !
At any rate it would be most ungenerous .
I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . ''
Amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one ; it was a man on horseback riding towards them .
In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman ; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed ,
`` Have you been lately in Sussex ? ''
`` Dear , dear Norland , '' said Elinor , `` probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year .
The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . ''
`` Because , '' replied he , smiling , `` among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . ''
His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible .
The whole family perceived it , and Mrs. Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents .
`` Elinor , for shame ! ''
Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . ''
Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna .
`` Why should you think so ! ''
The subject was continued no farther ; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent , till a new object suddenly engaged her attention .
The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother .
She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield , -- when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy .
But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger .
You may see her if you look this way . ''
Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told .
Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
`` My dear , '' said he to his lady , `` it is very provoking that we should be so few .
But , poor fellow !
From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding .
He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them .
`` I have a notion , '' said Lucy , `` you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . ''
`` We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , '' said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister .
your sister-in-law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ?
a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . ''
`` I am sorry I do NOT , '' said Elinor , in great astonishment , `` if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her .
But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . ''
`` We have been engaged these four years . ''
Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me .
Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a-year .
The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself .
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress .
`` I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned .
At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh ,
Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , `` This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one .
`` And what , '' said Mrs. Dashwood , `` is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?
What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ?
Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . ''
The Middletons were to follow in about a week .
She sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister .
To atone for this conduct therefore , Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets .
They reached town by three o'clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire .
About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived .
About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation .
Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him .
`` Good heavens ! ''
`` But he told you that he loved you . ''
`` The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her -- is very rich ? ''
Did you ever see her ?
I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man .
Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ?
I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round .
`` You mean , '' answered Elinor , with forced calmness , `` Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey .
This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us .
`` Yes , '' he replied gravely , `` once I have .
`` I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , '' said Miss Steele .
`` I am sorry she is not well -- '' for Marianne had left the room on their arrival .
`` I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed .
But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected .
And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing !
On Elinor its effect was very different .
Before her removing from Norland , Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration .
`` This is admiration of a very particular kind !
-- You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; -- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me .
Now was not it so ?
But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away .
Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne 's dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself .
The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon `` her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . ''
But I did not love only him ; -- and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt .
I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so .
`` Then , '' cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , `` he has acted like an honest man !
I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal .
And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? ''
we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . ''
`` You are very much mistaken .
I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it .
Elinor told him the number of the house .
`` Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , '' said he : -- '' I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.
NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.
-- how do you mean ? ''
`` Pray be quick , sir , '' -- said Elinor , impatiently ; -- '' I have no time to spare . ''
He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness .
`` To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness !
`` We are assured of it . ''
`` But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? ''
`` But she will be gained by some one else .
But he did not ask for hope or encouragement .
His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent .
Elinor could NOT remember it ; -- but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued ,
As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window .
In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.
-- She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile .
After dinner she would try her piano-forte .
`` There , exactly there , '' -- pointing with one hand , `` on that projecting mound , -- there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . ''
Marianne said not a word.
A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one .
`` It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . ''
Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . ''
Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future .
They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post-boys .
Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself .
But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .
What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother 's servant , on hearing Lucy 's message !
Elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said ,
Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . ''
Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income .
But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
No rumour of Lucy 's marriage had yet reached him : -- he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering .
Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour .
Love and Freindship Lesley Castle The History of England Collection of Letters Scraps LOVE AND FREINDSHIP TO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE FEUILLIDE THIS NOVEL IS INSCRIBED BY HER OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT THE AUTHOR .
When I had reached my eighteenth Year I was recalled by my Parents to my paternal roof in Wales .
Our mansion was situated in one of the most romantic parts of the Vale of Uske .
When in the Convent , my progress had always exceeded my instructions , my Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age , and I had shortly surpassed my Masters .
In my Mind , every Virtue that could adorn it was centered ; it was the Rendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment .
Tho' indeed my own Misfortunes do not make less impression on me than they ever did , yet now I never feel for those of an other .
She may probably have already told you that being left by her Parents in indigent Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical motives .
There it was our freindship first commenced .
Isobel was then one and twenty .
Tho ' pleasing both in her Person and Manners ( between ourselves ) she never possessed the hundredth part of my Beauty or Accomplishments .
What probability is there of my ever tasting the Dissipations of London , the Luxuries of Bath , or the stinking Fish of Southampton ?
My Father started -- '' What noise is that , '' ( said he . )
`` It sounds like a loud rapping at the door '' -- ( replied my Mother . )
`` Yes ( exclaimed I ) I can not help thinking it must be somebody who knocks for admittance . ''
Here , a 2d tremendous rap interrupted my Father in his speech , and somewhat alarmed my Mother and me .
( said she ) the servants are out . ''
`` I think we had . ''
`` Shall we go now ? ''
`` I am certain there is somebody knocking at the Door . ''
( said I . )
Your Virtues my amiable Polydore ( addressing himself to my father ) yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to repose in you , my confidence . ''
Lady Dorothea is lovely and Engaging ; I prefer no woman to her ; but know Sir , that I scorn to marry her in compliance with your Wishes .
By our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho ' their means for supplying them were then nearly exhausted .
But they , Exalted Creatures !
scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and would have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.
what was their Reward for such disinterested Behaviour !
The beautifull Augustus was arrested and we were all undone .
`` To Newgate Gentle Youth ( replied I ) , to see Augustus . ''
As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her Sentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the Country .
You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest Marianne , that in the Distress I then endured , destitute of any support , and unprovided with any Habitation , I should never once have remembered my Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of Uske .
To account for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a trifling circumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned .
Such is the Depravity of the World !
Alas , what would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus !
to know if he is still in Newgate , or if he is yet hung .
Amidst all my Lamentations for her ( and violent you may suppose they were ) I yet received some consolation in the reflection of my having paid every attention to her , that could be offered , in her illness .
`` My beloved Laura ( said she to me a few Hours before she died ) take warning from my unhappy End and avoid the imprudent conduct which had occasioned it ... Beware of fainting-fits ...
A frenzy fit is not one quarter so pernicious ; it is an exercise to the Body and if not too violent , is I dare say conducive to Health in its consequences -- Run mad as often as you chuse ; but do not faint -- ''
I graciously promised that I would , but could not help observing that the unsimpathetic Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow of Edward than in being the refined and amiable Laura .
You may imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have him play her such a trick .
I know not when we shall leave Bristol , Eloisa 's spirits are so low that she is very averse to moving , and yet is certainly by no means mended by her residence here .
A week or two will I hope determine our Measures -- in the mean time believe me and etc -- and etc -- Charlotte Lutterell .
It is to be supposed that Henry was married , since he had certainly four sons , but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife .
Be this as it may , he did not live for ever , but falling ill , his son the Prince of Wales came and took away the crown ; whereupon the King made a long speech , for which I must refer the Reader to Shakespear's Plays , and the Prince made a still longer .
It would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were not as well acquainted with the particulars of this King 's reign as I am myself .
It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what they have read before , and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not perfectly recollect , by giving only a slight sketch of the principal Events which marked his reign .
Among these may be ranked Cardinal Wolsey 's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that `` he was come to lay his bones among them , '' the reformation in Religion and the King's riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen .
Tho ' I do not profess giving many dates , yet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know , I think it right to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of May .
The Kings last wife contrived to survive him , but with difficulty effected it .
He was succeeded by his only son Edward .
SHARADE My first is what my second was to King James the 1st , and you tread on my whole .
The principal favourites of his Majesty were Car , who was afterwards created Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share in the above mentioned Sharade , and George Villiers afterwards Duke of Buckingham .
`` I have not ridden , continued she fixing her Eyes on my face , since I was married . ''
I was never so surprised -- '' Married , Ma'am ! ''
`` Then why are you called Miss Jane ? ''
`` Have you been long in Essex Ma'am ? ''
appearing surprised at my question , from Suffolk . ''
Whenever I am however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile , I shall know where to apply . ''
I bowed , but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse ; still however I had not given up my point .
Words can not express how happy your Letter made me ; I thought I should have cried for joy , for I love you better than any body in the World .
Do write me another just like it , and tell me you are in love with me in every other line .
for we are so much in love that we can not live asunder .
THE FIRST ACT OF A COMEDY
SCENE CHANGES TO THE SUN --
TO BE LETT A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and about three Miles from the Sea .
It is ready furnished except two rooms and a Closet .
of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still-born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 . ''
of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , '' and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife .
Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto : -- '' Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , '' and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale : -- `` Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq.
, great grandson of the second Sir Walter . ''
He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty-four , was still a very fine man .
Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards.
-- Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father .
She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .
Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake .
Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily .
His two other children were of very inferior value .
She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two .
Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .
She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .
, whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .
She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should .
He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded .
No ; he would never disgrace his name so far .
The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds , is another thing .
I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden .
was the reply , and with a look of surprise .
`` And a very well-spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , '' continued he ; `` asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford .
Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ? ''
Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day 's health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath .
And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now .
One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times .
Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .
It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . ''
The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before .
And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles .
Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less .
How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness !
Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !
He got up and moved away .
It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth .
She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do .
In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it .
cried he , catching the same tone ; `` I honour you ! ''
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; '' and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .
He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion .
Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne 's face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of .
She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced .
It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly .
Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it .
He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , `` That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . ''
cried Mary in an ecstasy , `` just as I said !
I was sure that would come out , if it was so .
I wish I had looked at him more .
But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen .
Louisa was much the same .
Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account .
In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse .
Mary had been hysterical again this morning .
A few days had made a change indeed !
`` Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it .
So , I give you notice , Lady Russell . ''
Captain Benwick came not , however .
Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , `` Oh !
A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good .
Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .
Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess .
`` She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance . ''
The toils of the business were over , the sweets began .
My cousin Anne shakes her head .
My dear cousin '' ( sitting down by her ) , `` you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ?
Will it make you happy ?
You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . ''
An excellent , good-hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . ''
She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed .
One can guess what will happen there .
He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe .
`` By all means , '' said she ; `` only tell me all about it , when you do come .
No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery .
To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity .
he replied impressively , `` there is nothing worth my staying for ; '' and he was gone directly .
`` I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ? ''
One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief .
Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen .
He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion .
This was the letter , directed to `` Charles Smith , Esq .
I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it .
The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough .
Did he see you last summer or autumn , 'somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? ''
The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it .
After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence : -- '' Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long .
We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . ''
As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was .
`` Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like .
I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all .
I have engaged Captain Wentworth .
`` You were not formerly , I know .
Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her .
`` I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood .
Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening .
There could not be an objection .
There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture .
To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself .
Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart .
Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart .
Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's affection .
His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine .
`` My dearest papa !
Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness .
Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .
He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle 's heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .
It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father 's assistance .
His father had no apprehension of it .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse 's giving a gentle sigh , and saying , `` Ah , poor Miss Taylor !
Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with .
I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith .
She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be .
They will read together .
-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned .
Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
-- They only give a little polish . ''
`` I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance .
regular features , open countenance , with a complexion !
There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .
One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health .
Mr. Knightley , is not she ? ''
But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . ''
`` I had only my own family to study from .
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
-- and the face not unlike .
Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
-- This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness .
I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it -- ( Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like ) -- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side '' -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of -- '' Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
But for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , I will break my resolution now . ''
It is the fault of her face that she has them not . ''
`` Do you think so ? ''
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .
Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .
`` Will you read the letter ? ''
`` No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ?
What would you advise me to do ?
Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do . ''
I will have nothing to do with it .
`` Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .
We will not be parted .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . ''
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . ''
He presently added , with a smile ,
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . ''
Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief .
Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .
Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ?
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage . ''
`` I never read one more to the purpose , certainly . ''
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !
I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married . ''
`` Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama .
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
John , the second , is named after his father .
Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
I think their father is too rough with them very often . ''
`` Oh , what a sweet house !
Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts .
Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all-sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother 's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.
`` A material difference then , '' she replied -- '' and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ? ''
How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night . ''
`` I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
`` A man , '' said he , `` must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing .
Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse ; -- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . ''
They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .
She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , `` Much the same -- not better . ''
`` _My_ report from Mrs. Goddard 's , '' said she presently , `` was not so pleasant as I had hoped -- 'Not better ' was _my_ answer . ''
`` We are sure of excellent fires , '' continued he , `` and every thing in the greatest comfort .
Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; -- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ; -- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .
Mr. Weston 's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . ''
Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .
Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly .
He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .
-- what is to be done ? ''
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
`` Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold .
-- you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say .
`` I am ready , if the others are . ''
`` I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton .
-- How eager he had been about the picture !
-- and the charade !
To be sure , the charade , with its `` ready wit '' -- but then the `` soft eyes '' -- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father 's being given a moment's uneasiness about it .
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
`` Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it .
He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain .
His letters disgust me . ''
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well-grown and good-looking , with smooth , plausible manners . ''
If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . ''
I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ; -- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
It is such a blessing !
Jane often says , when she is here , 'I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !
-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well . '
I think they judge wisely .
But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed .
`` You think her diffident .
`` I hope every body had a pleasant evening , '' said Mr. Woodhouse , in his quiet way .
Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .
She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . ''
`` True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . ''
`` It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !
He had time only to say ,
`` Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away .
I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .
Mr. Knightley is coming too .
-- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .
It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance -- !
`` Think of me to-morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , '' was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her .
The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency .
He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
-- At least you admire her except her complexion . ''
I will move a little farther off . ''
As Mrs. Weston observed , `` all young people would have their little whims . ''
There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , `` Hum !
With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company .
They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield .
Their love of society , and their new dining-room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place .
Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
`` He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard .
He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
James could take the note .
You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course .
I shall have no fears for you with him .
This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure !
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.
`` Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . ''
`` What do you say to Mrs .
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship .
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . ''
He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .
no , no ; -- every feeling revolts .
`` But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry .
Do not put it into his head .
-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children .
He was no dancer in general .
There was no immediate appearance .
No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole .
I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .
The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
`` Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied .
This is what we all feel .
you were perfectly right !
`` She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing .
She will not even listen to your questions .
All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley 's provoking indifference about it .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
-- Every body so happy !
His dejection was most evident .
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .
`` Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . ''
Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . ''
`` Mrs. Weston 's manners , '' said Emma , `` were always particularly good .
-- for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity .
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
I like him very much .
Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman-like man . ''
-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman !
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !
Always the first person to be thought of !
`` I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
`` Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible .
It was being very deficient . ''
`` My dear , you do not understand me .
`` I should not wonder , '' said Mrs. Weston , `` if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . ''
`` You are not vain , Mr. Knightley .
I will say that for you . ''
`` Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
They met with the utmost friendliness .
But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .
Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects .
Two months must bring it to the proof .
He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages , -- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
An unpretending , single-minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton .
when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
After another short hesitation , `` I hope it does not proceed from -- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr .
You wrote me word of it three months ago . ''
`` Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . ''
`` Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . ''
The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .
In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home ; -- and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . ''
-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.
-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.
-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal.
-- The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear .
`` Yes -- what should hurt me ?
-- I walk fast .
Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? ''
I shall sit by you .
If I come , I shall be cross . ''
`` You are comfortable because you are under command . ''
`` It is a sort of thing , '' cried Mrs. Elton emphatically , `` which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
`` You were speaking , '' said he , gravely .
`` Now , ma'am , '' said Jane to her aunt , `` shall we join Mrs .
`` Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . ''
She will break it to you better than I can .
Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon . ''
-- One of the Otways.
`` Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . ''
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !
Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush .
cried Emma , after a moment 's pause -- '' What do you mean ?
-- Am I to suppose then ?
Are you speaking of -- Mr .
To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour .
I am always well , you know .
All that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of Donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ?
Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
He listened in perfect silence .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
-- I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.
And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour .
-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.
-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . ''
`` I hope he does , '' replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
What is all this ? ''
She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .
`` When I got to Donwell , '' said he , `` Knightley could not be found .
`` He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , '' interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile -- '' much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . ''
As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.
She must not appear to think it a misfortune.
You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,
`` I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.
-- I am sure you had.
`` Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth .
I think there is a little likeness between us . ''
A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !
-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
Still , however , he was not happy .
Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury .
`` It would have been very shocking to have it torn , '' said she , `` would not it ?
It is such a delicate muslin .
`` Why , indeed ! ''
said he , in his natural tone .
Now let us go on .
Were you never here before , madam ? ''
`` Well then , I will not . ''
As soon as divine service was over , the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other ; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable , and that there was not a genteel face to be seen , which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season , they hastened away to the Crescent , to breathe the fresh air of better company .
He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle-drivers of the morning .
Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return .
The following conversation , which took place between the two friends in the pump-room one morning , after an acquaintance of eight or nine days , is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment , and of the delicacy , discretion , originality of thought , and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment .
`` No , she does not .
Do you like them best dark or fair ? ''
I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us .
Half a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway , opposite Union Passage ; but here they were stopped .
`` I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow . ''
Not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . ''
`` Indeed I am , '' she replied ; `` I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too .
`` Very agreeable , madam . ''
And what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ''
`` You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , '' said Thorpe , as he handed her in , `` if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off .
He will , most likely , give a plunge or two , and perhaps take the rest for a minute ; but he will soon know his master .
He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . ''
Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal 's boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her .
Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip .
The carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out .
I would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ''
How do you like my gown ?
We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place ; really , our opinions were so exactly the same , it was quite ridiculous !
`` Perhaps we -- Yes , I think we certainly shall . ''
This civility was duly returned ; and they parted -- on Miss Tilney 's side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance 's feelings , and on Catherine 's , without the smallest consciousness of having explained them .
`` Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , '' whispered Isabella , `` but I am really going to dance with your brother again .
I declare positively it is quite shocking .
Take care , or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time .
`` What a picture of intellectual poverty !
`` Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do .
And in two minutes they were off .
Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind .
Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others ?
Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish , regardless of everything but her own gratification .
I think you can not stand out any longer now .
They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff , that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath .
`` Because they are not clever enough for you -- gentlemen read better books . ''
`` Very true , '' said Henry , `` and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies .
Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement -- people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice .
If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person 's courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ''
Where could you hear of such a thing ? ''
No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen 's side , and the only difficulty on Catherine 's was in concealing the excess of her pleasure .
She thought it would be something very fine .
I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . ''
`` Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ''
`` With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person 's feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered -- but , How should I be influenced , What would be my inducement in acting so and so ? ''
James Morland 's second letter was then received , and the kind intentions of his father fully explained .
Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage .
To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one , or the cloisters of the other , had been for many weeks a darling wish , though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire .
And yet , this was to happen .
With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant .
`` Why do you put such things into my head ?
`` If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . ''
`` This is strange indeed !
I did not expect such a sight as this !
If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ''
With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her .
Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession !
Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the general , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner-table , when the general 's complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
The dining-parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants .
Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the general , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , `` that she must have been used to much better-sized apartments at Mr .
Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ?
If the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing-bill in her hand .
She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new .
And the larger sheet , which had enclosed the rest , seemed by its first cramp line , `` To poultice chestnut mare '' -- a farrier 's bill !
To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable !
`` What say you , Eleanor ?
I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations .
The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east , with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son .
Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business .
But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment .
The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing .
Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . ''
The kitchen-garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park .
The walls seemed countless in number , endless in length ; a village of hot-houses seemed to arise among them , and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure .
The general was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , `` without any ambition of that sort himself -- without any solicitude about it -- he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .
He loved a garden .
The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits .
`` No , not at all .
Yet the general would not enter it . ''
Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , `` Her death must have been a great affliction ! ''
She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary .
said she , in a tone of feeling .
`` Yes , entirely . ''
The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments .
The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew .
By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears .
No theatre , no rooms to prepare for .
Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe 's works , and charming even as were the works of all her imitators , it was not in them perhaps that human nature , at least in the Midland counties of England , was to be looked for .
Of the Alps and Pyrenees , with their pine forests and their vices , they might give a faithful delineation ; and Italy , Switzerland , and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented .
Murder was not tolerated , servants were not slaves , and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured , like rhubarb , from every druggist .
Among the Alps and Pyrenees , perhaps , there were no mixed characters .
Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .
The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance .
Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater .
Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella .
`` Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
I shall not enter into particulars -- they would only pain you more .
I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
I have written to him and my father .
I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man .
I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney .
`` I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
I am very sorry for Mr. Morland -- sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick 's marrying her than at any other part of the story . ''
A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney .
His brother and sister knew not what to think .
He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day 's society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood .
But then it was such a dead time of year , no wild-fowl , no game , and the Lady Frasers were not in the country .
And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him .
`` And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ?
I know no one more entitled , by unpretending merit , or better prepared by habitual suffering , to receive and enjoy felicity .
Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary ; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all .
He desires me to tell you that the present open weather induces him to accept Mr. Vernon 's invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex , that they may have some hunting together .
Lady Susan has certainly contrived , in the space of a fortnight , to make my brother like her .
In short , I am persuaded that his continuing here beyond the time originally fixed for his return is occasioned as much by a degree of fascination towards her , as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon , and of course I can not receive that pleasure from the length of his visit which my brother 's company would otherwise give me .
Let me congratulate you , my dearest Mother !
The affair which has given us so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion .
`` Catherine , '' said he , `` I am going home to-day ; I am sorry to leave you , but I must go : it is a great while since I have seen my father and mother .
He wants to marry her ; her mother promotes the match , but she can not endure the idea of it .
Good bye , '' he added , shaking my hand with earnestness ; `` I do not know when you will see me again ; but remember what I tell you of Frederica ; you MUST make it your business to see justice done her .
She is an amiable girl , and has a very superior mind to what we have given her credit for . ''
He then left me , and ran upstairs .
Mistress of deceit , however , she appeared perfectly unconcerned , and after chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time , said to me , `` I find from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy -- is it true that he leaves Churchhill this morning ? ''
I trust , however , my dear mother , that we have no reason to fear an alteration of his present plan ; things have gone too far .
Her calmness astonishes me .
What delight will be yours in seeing him again ; in seeing him still worthy your esteem , still capable of forming your happiness !
We have much to do , but it shall be done .
I finish as I began , with the warmest congratulations .
We misunderstood each other : he believed me more to blame than I really was ; I considered his interference less excusable than I now find it .
I could have said , `` Not much , indeed ! ''
I could not have stopped myself had I begun .
My heart sickens within me .
As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned to the parlour .
Sir James 's carriage was at the door , and he , merry as usual , soon afterwards took his leave .
How easily does her ladyship encourage or dismiss a lover !
He thinks very differently of her from what he used to do ; he does her some justice , but his reconciliation with her mother precludes every dearer hope .
Prepare , my dear mother , for the worst !
I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days .
It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others .
`` My dear little cousin , '' said he , with all the gentleness of an excellent nature , `` what can be the matter ? ''
or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia ?
`` But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant !
She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _the_ _Island_ , as if there were no other island in the world .
As for Fanny 's being stupid at learning , `` she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _were_ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ''
He knew her to be clever , to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense , and a fondness for reading , which , properly directed , must be an education in itself .
In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William : her heart was divided between the two .
My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ''
`` Why , you know , Sir Thomas 's means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ''
The earliest intelligence of the travellers ' safe arrival at Antigua , after a favourable voyage , was received ; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears , and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone ; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe , she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others , when Sir Thomas 's assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while .
`` My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business .
What is this but a take in ? ''
I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_ .
When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too .
The Crawfords , without wanting to be cured , were very willing to stay .
He had come , intending to spend only a few days with them ; but Mansfield promised well , and there was nothing to call him elsewhere .
It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay-at-home man ; and Mr. Crawford 's being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day .
Edmund , to whom this was chiefly addressed , replied , `` I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question .
She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . ''
The expense need not be any impediment .
But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting .
He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of .
If it had not been for _that_ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done .
`` Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , '' said Julia .
Why should not we make a little party ?
Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford 's opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight .
Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ''
cried Julia : `` go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche !
No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . ''
Every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisades and gates .
The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which reigned in it , with few interruptions , throughout the year .
`` James , '' said Mrs. Rushworth to her son , `` I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party .
Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of that end of the house .
I thought _that_ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ''
`` _You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend .
`` Do you mean literally or figuratively ?
`` But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key .
Do wait for Mr .
`` What else have you been spunging ? ''
Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . ''
`` Yes , and the Bear .
I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ''
`` The couple above , ma'am .
I quite detest her .
`` It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , '' said Fanny , shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room , and to feel that almost every eye was upon her ; `` but I really can not act . ''
`` I want to consult .
He had told her the most extraordinary , the most inconceivable , the most unwelcome news ; and she could think of nothing else .
it was all Miss Crawford 's doing .
Her cousins might attack , but could hardly tease her .
For a day or two after the affront was given , Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment , but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses ; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation , he grew indifferent to the quarrel , or rather thought it a lucky occurrence , as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant .
What is the play about , Fanny ?
Fanny was most civil in her assurances , though she could not give them in a very steady voice .
Surprise , consciousness , and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting ; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _them_ .
`` To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening .
Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to-night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to-morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result .
We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ''
He must like him less after to-morrow's visit , for we shall be five hours in his company .
I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow -- the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas .
Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before .
In that house , which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's death , she became a welcome , an invited guest , and in the gloom and dirt of a November day , most acceptable to Mary Crawford .
Her visits there , beginning by chance , were continued by solicitation .
`` To say the truth , '' replied Miss Crawford , `` I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV .
; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it .
`` I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself , but , '' and her eyes brightened as she spoke , `` take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer .
But then , '' with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice , `` there is no saying what it may lead to . ''
Poverty is exactly what I have determined against .
Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . ''
Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear .
It began , on Lady Bertram 's part , with -- '' I have something to tell you that will surprise you .
Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state .
With a significant smile , which made Fanny quite hate him , he said , `` So !
His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying , `` Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves .
`` Will he not feel this ? ''
No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul !
A very few days were enough to effect this ; and at the end of those few days , circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her , inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody .
William , her brother , the so long absent and dearly loved brother , was in England again .
William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker .
`` I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey -- for such it certainly was . ''
`` We shall be the losers , '' continued Sir Thomas .
It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford .
But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent .
But it will not .
He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well-wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ''
`` If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps . ''
Fanny , in dismay at such an unprecedented question , did not know which way to look , or how to be prepared for the answer .
Some very grave reproof , or at least the coldest expression of indifference , must be coming to distress her brother , and sink her to the ground .
You spoke of the balls at Northampton .
The fatigue would be too much for your aunt .
A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if -- ''
Fanny still resisted , and from her heart .
She looked and looked , longing to know which might be least valuable ; and was determined in her choice at last , by fancying there was one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest .
It was of gold , prettily worked ; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose , she hoped , in fixing on this , to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep .
Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness , and , excepting what remained of her scruples , was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos .
But this was an unworthy feeling .
Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved her a real friend .
`` When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , '' said she , `` and feel how very kind you were . ''
To take what had been the gift of another person , of a brother too , impossible !
Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness .
`` My dear child , '' said she , laughing , `` what are you afraid of ?
With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought .
He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace -- she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend .
She was one of his two dearest -- that must support her .
It was a stab , in spite of every long-standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation .
She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self-government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , `` My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept '' locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift .
It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him ; she might never receive another ; it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style .
Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author -- never more completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer .
They were now on the second floor , and the appearance of a housemaid prevented any farther conversation .
Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford 's note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her .
William 's good fortune returned again upon her mind , and seemed of greater value than at first .
The ball , too -- such an evening of pleasure before her !
It was now a real animation ; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball .
All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross .
His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross -- those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary -- and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford 's necklace too .
Fanny was confused , but it was the confusion of discontent ; while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile , and thought her over-anxious , or thought her odd , or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry 's attentions .
She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so very soon , and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris , about the supper hour , were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening .
But it was not to be avoided : he made her feel that she was the object of all ; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done , that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner ; and sometimes , when he talked of William , he was really not unagreeable , and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit .
She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _him_ was in continual perspective .
She was happy even when they did take place ; but not from any flow of spirits on his side , or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning .
`` I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say .
But with _you_ , Fanny , there may be peace .
Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement .
A weariness , arising probably , in great measure , from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning , was peculiarly to be respected , and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son .
Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to-morrow . ''
All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so .
`` Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ''
That Mansfield should have done so much for -- that _you_ should have found your fate in Mansfield !
But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better .
There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good .
The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country .
She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world .
`` The more I think of it , '' she cried , `` the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy .
When she had spoken it , she recollected herself , and wished it unsaid ; but there was no need of confusion ; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage , and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house , and to claim the best right in her .
Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . ''
Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections -- ''
Now she was angry .
Here was again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before .
how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in !
Sir Thomas was obliged , or obliged himself , to wait till the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between the young people .
The first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour 's entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny ; but there was speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover ; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal , Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself .
Nothing was omitted , on his side , of civility , compliment , or kindness , that might assist the plan .
`` My dear aunt , _you_ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure .
_You_ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ?
They sat so much longer than usual in the dining-parlour , that she was sure they must be talking of her ; and when tea at last brought them away , and she was to be seen by Edmund again , she felt dreadfully guilty .
He came to her , sat down by her , took her hand , and pressed it kindly ; and at that moment she thought that , but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded , she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess .
Fanny was worth it all ; he held her to be worth every effort of patience , every exertion of mind , but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman breathing , without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers .
She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and good-nature together could do ; or , at least , she would not be won by them nearly so soon , without the assistance of sentiment and feeling , and seriousness on serious subjects .
A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords' departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible .
Her spirits were low .
But how could you possibly suppose me against you ?
Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ''
If she could have believed Mary 's future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother's should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford 's marrying Edmund than it had ever been before .
He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed -- perhaps within a fortnight ; he talked of going , he loved to talk of it ; and when once with her again , Fanny could not doubt the rest .
Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William 's mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize-money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together .
Miss Crawford 's style of writing , lively and affectionate , was itself an evil , independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother 's pen , for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him ; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language , and the warmth of her attachments .
With such thoughts as these , among ten hundred others , Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully , and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February .
The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her father 's , not at all calculated to compose them .
How they are singing out !
That boy is fit for a boatswain .
Holla , you there !
Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . ''
`` What have you got there , my love ? ''
said Fanny ; `` come and shew it to me . ''
Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece 's feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night 's rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .
Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity .
In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson 's celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures .
They sat without a fire ; but that was a privation familiar even to Fanny , and she suffered the less because reminded by it of the East room .
In space , light , furniture , and prospect , there was nothing alike in the two apartments ; and she often heaved a sigh at the remembrance of all her books and boxes , and various comforts there .
And to be having any one 's improvement in view in her choice !
I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt .
Perhaps I may be to stay longer .
Fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say .
Is there anything I can do for you in town ?
I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible , and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill , which I design for somebody else .
Would it not be worse than simple ?
If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state .
`` What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ?
Not till after Easter !
And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ''
There was a rich amends , however , preparing for her .
Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund's letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus --
So long divided and so differently situated , the ties of blood were little more than nothing .
A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother 's letter was enough for Fanny 's information .
Tom 's amendment was alarmingly slow .
`` With what intense desire she wants her home , '' was continually on her tongue , as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy 's bosom to feel more keenly .
Portsmouth was Portsmouth ; Mansfield was home .
She reproached herself , coloured , and looked fearfully towards her father and mother .
`` I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it .
Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to-day ; the old lady is come .
Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond .
He does it every spring .
At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours .
Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come .
It will do us all good .
I have not time or patience to give half Henry 's messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . ''
As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself .
But , by G -- !
`` It is a mistake , sir , '' said Fanny instantly ; `` it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ''
She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame ; she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair , for she spoke what she did not , could not believe herself .
It had been the shock of conviction as she read .
There is nothing like employment , active indispensable employment , for relieving sorrow .
Business followed business ; the day was hardly long enough .
The happiness she was imparting , too , happiness very little alloyed by the black communication which must briefly precede it -- the joyful consent of her father and mother to Susan 's going with her -- the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded , and the ecstasy of Susan herself , was all serving to support her spirits .
Does Susan go ? ''
His great object was to be off as soon as possible .
She knew it must be so , but it was terrible to her .
She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it .
If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _that_ she found was not to be .
She seldom saw him : never alone .
He probably avoided being alone with her .
That his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family affliction , but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the slightest communication .
After a little reflection , he went on with a sort of desperate calmness .
`` I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever .
The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short -- oh , Fanny !
it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated .
It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself .
He was entangled by his own vanity , with as little excuse of love as possible , and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her cousin .
