`` Do you not want to know who has taken it ? ''
`` _You_ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ''
`` What is his name ? ''
Single , my dear , to be sure !
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .
`` My dear Mr. Bennet , '' replied his wife , `` how can you be so tiresome !
Nonsense , how can you talk so !
But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . ''
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now .
When a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ''
`` But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ''
`` It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ''
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good-humoured as Lydia .
`` They have none of them much to recommend them , '' replied he ; `` they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ''
You have no compassion for my poor nerves . ''
`` You mistake me , my dear .
I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . ''
`` But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ''
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develop .
`` But you forget , mamma , '' said Elizabeth , `` that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . ''
She has two nieces of her own .
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply , but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .
Have a little compassion on my nerves .
You tear them to pieces . ''
`` Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_ . ''
A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little .
But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ''
`` Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?
Mary wished to say something sensible , but knew not how .
`` While Mary is adjusting her ideas , '' he continued , `` let us return to Mr .
`` I am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me that before ?
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ''
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and , consequently , unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc .
Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted .
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .
What a contrast between him and his friend !
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again .
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
`` _You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , '' said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited .
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .
Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice .
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her -- indeed I rather believe he _did_ -- I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr .
the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt ; there can not be two opinions on that point . '
`` Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to . ''
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
`` It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased , '' said Miss Lucas .
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who , with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity :
If I wished to think slightingly of anybody 's children , it should not be of my own , however . ''
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his regimentals . ''
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane .
`` She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .
She really looked almost wild . ''
`` Not at all , '' he replied ; `` they were brightened by the exercise . ''
`` That is capital , '' added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend 's vulgar relations .
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen .
`` Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ''
`` Elizabeth Bennet , '' said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , `` is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . ''
`` I did not know before , '' continued Bingley immediately , `` that you were a studier of character .
`` Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition .
But that gentleman , '' looking at Darcy , `` seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ''
`` Nay , '' cried Bingley , `` this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .
`` Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter ; Darcy must speak for himself . ''
As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ''
`` No , no ; stay where you are .
When tea was over , Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain .
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her .
`` Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .
But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
He begged pardon for having displeased her .
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
`` I can not pretend to be sorry , '' said Wickham , after a short interruption , `` that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen .
`` I wonder , '' said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , `` whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ''
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence -- in short anything or nothing .
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely .
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . ''
He has also _brotherly_ pride , which , with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister , and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . ''
`` He is a sweet-tempered , amiable , charming man .
He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . ''
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ''
`` You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr .
`` While I can have my mornings to myself , '' said she , `` it is enough -- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . ''
One must speak a little , you know .
Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus :
The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing , that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further , and he continued :
`` You forget that I have made no answer .
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them . ''
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _do_ . ''
Mr. Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them .
I am not romantic , you know ; I never was .
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family .
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .
As for Jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth 's , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
It needed all Jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
`` My dear Jane ! ''
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you .
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .
`` I do not blame Jane , '' she continued , `` for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could .
`` Elizabeth , you are not serious now . ''
I need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago .
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.
-- Yours , etc . ''
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good-humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William 's too long .
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?
It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . ''
Mr. Collins 's triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete .
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine 's condescension , as he knew not how to admire enough .
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings .
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them .
But really , ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .
`` Upon my word , '' said her ladyship , `` you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .
Pray , what is your age ? ''
`` We are speaking of music , madam , '' said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
She practises very constantly . ''
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?
My fingers wait your orders . ''
`` Perhaps , '' said Darcy , `` I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction ; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ''
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility , and , at the request of the gentlemen , remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .
All field sports were over .
Does your charge give you much trouble ?
What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
`` You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr. Phillips 's .
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .
`` It was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
But it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .
`` I have heard much of your master 's fine person , '' said Mrs. Gardiner , looking at the picture ; `` it is a handsome face .
Elizabeth coloured , and said : `` A little . ''
`` And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? ''
`` And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ''
`` Not so much as I could wish , sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ''
`` Perhaps we might be deceived . ''
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley .
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street .
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival to Jane .
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . ''
Eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia 's situation , hastily exclaimed , `` I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day . ''
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . ''
`` But why all this secrecy ?
Why must their marriage be private ?
His most particular friend , you see by Jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
He can not afford it .
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
`` But does Lydia know nothing of this ?
can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ''
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
`` Not yet , '' replied Jane .
`` But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ''
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
`` Is it possible ? ''
`` Can it be possible that he will marry her ? ''
`` Let me write for you , '' said Jane , `` if you dislike the trouble yourself . ''
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .
You were not by , when I told mamma and the others all about it .
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ''
`` Not that I _shall_ , though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
`` I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . ''
my dear Lydia , '' she cried , `` when shall we meet again ? ''
`` 'T is an etiquette I despise , '' said he .
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley , in consequence of it , before _they_ did .
`` Yet why did he come ? ''
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
what has she to do with it ?
Where is your sash , my dear ? ''
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes .
Their situation was awkward enough ; but _hers_ she thought was still worse .
`` With my mother up stairs .
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ''
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ''
Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? ''
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .
Her ladyship was highly incensed .
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , `` I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .
I send no compliments to your mother .
I am most seriously displeased . ''
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
`` If you _will_ thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone .
Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _you_ . ''
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .
`` I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
But with me , it is not so .
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .
Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , I was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ''
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here ; and I was convinced of her affection . ''
_That_ is all to be forgot .
`` Very , very much .
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .
I am afraid you will be angry . ''
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs. Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
`` He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time .
Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . ''
We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives .
I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart .
`` Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits .
I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . ''
Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession .
-- The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter .
Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure .
He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away .
In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey .
They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy .
He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen .
But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw .
This was the season of happiness to Marianne .
`` There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , '' said Sir John , `` when once you are determined on anything .
`` I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns .
I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . ''
`` I assure you it is not in my power . ''
`` Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? ''
To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing .
`` I hope not , '' he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , `` It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! ''
`` I hope not , I believe not , '' cried Elinor .
He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed .
In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character ; -- but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . ''
`` I would not ask such a question for the world .
I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible .
Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder .
He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception .
Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself .
said Marianne , `` money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it .
Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his .
The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . ''
`` Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . ''
Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son .
Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother .
The old well-established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all .
It is only the Palmers .
Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you .
As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused .
Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John .
Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? ''
You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming !
for he is forced to make every body like him . ''
Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world .
Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests .
Benevolent , philanthropic man !
She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it .
Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask .
As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself .
And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house .
Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion .
I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while .
`` Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . ''
They were again silent for many minutes .
It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . ''
They were three days on their journey , and Marianne 's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be .
In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere .
I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . ''
She determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair .
`` And now , '' silently conjectured Elinor , `` she will write to Combe by this day 's post . ''
His card was on the table when they came in from the morning 's drive .
why does he not look at me ?
Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence .
`` How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town .
An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist .
`` Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . ''
`` Fifty thousand pounds , my dear .
a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome .
Well , it don't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him .
But that wo n't do now-a-days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . ''
Yes , we DO know it all .
Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable !
Where did you hear it ? ''
One meeting was unavoidable . ''
She could soon tell at what coachmaker 's the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr. Willoughby 's portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey 's clothes might be seen .
When they stopped at the door , Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray 's , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their 's , she should pay her visit and return for them .
She began immediately to determine , that Edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of Lucy !
Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough , -- for , colouring a little , she immediately said ,
-- what is Miss Morton to us ?
-- who knows , or who cares , for her ?
The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away .
`` My dear friend , '' cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , `` I come to talk to you of my happiness .
Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ?
-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? ''
To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent , as not to bestow half the consideration on it , during the whole of her toilet , which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together , when it was finished .
`` Four months ! ''
-- and yet you loved him ! ''
I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther .
Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.
-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER . ''
`` If such is your way of thinking , '' said Marianne , `` if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self-command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.
I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . ''
Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett 's Buildings .
`` That is a good thing .
Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ; '' -- was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled -- '' for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ; -- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back !
I have had no hand in it .
As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . ''
When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared .
-- Why would not Marianne come ? ''
`` I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . ''
The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland .
With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner .
She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking .
His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor .
`` With me ! ''
-- in the utmost amazement -- '' well , sir , -- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent . ''
He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her .
-- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ?
-- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless .
Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed .
I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound .
But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort .
A discovery took place , '' -- here he hesitated and looked down.
Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther , '' he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye -- '' your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago . ''
my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself .
Marianne might at that moment be dying .
She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing.
-- She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much .
She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister 's , and tears covered her cheeks .
I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.
-- I should have had no confidence , no esteem .
`` I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was .
I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . ''
That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first .
They were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle 's .
`` Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? ''
`` It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , '' said he , `` the consequence of ignorance of the world -- and want of employment .
-- She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . ''
`` Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love . ''
LETTER the FIRST From ISABEL to LAURA How often , in answer to my repeated intreaties that you would give my Daughter a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of your Life , have you said `` No , my freind never will I comply with your request till I may be no longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones . ''
Surely that time is now at hand .
You are this day 55 .
Isabel LETTER 2nd LAURA to ISABEL Altho ' I can not agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be exposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced , yet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature , I will gratify the curiosity of your daughter ; and may the fortitude with which I have suffered the many afflictions of my past Life , prove to her a useful lesson for the support of those which may befall her in her own .
Laura LETTER 3rd LAURA to MARIANNE As the Daughter of my most intimate freind I think you entitled to that knowledge of my unhappy story , which your Mother has so often solicited me to give you .
My Father was a native of Ireland and an inhabitant of Wales ; my Mother was the natural Daughter of a Scotch Peer by an italian Opera-girl -- I was born in Spain and received my Education at a Convent in France .
But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were the least of my Perfections .
LETTER 4th Laura to MARIANNE Our neighbourhood was small , for it consisted only of your Mother .
Isabel had seen the World .
`` Beware my Laura ( she would often say ) Beware of the insipid Vanities and idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England ; Beware of the unmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton . ''
I who am doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an humble Cottage in the Vale of Uske . ''
`` it does indeed . ''
`` Had we better not go and see who it is ?
`` Certainly , ( added my Father ) by all means . ''
( said my Mother , ) `` The sooner the better . ''
A third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears .
`` I 'm glad of it ( cried my Father ) for I long to know who it is . ''
I was right in my conjecture ; for Mary instantly entering the Room , informed us that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door , who had lossed their way , were very cold and begged leave to warm themselves by our fire .
`` Wo n't you admit them ? ''
( replied my Mother . )
The servant she kept to herself .
My natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the sufferings of the unfortunate stranger and no sooner did I first behold him , than I felt that on him the happiness or Misery of my future Life must depend .
LETTER 6th LAURA to MARIANNE The noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay -- for particular reasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot .
`` My Father ( he continued ) is a mean and mercenary wretch -- it is only to such particular freinds as this Dear Party that I would thus betray his failings .
`` My Father seduced by the false glare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title , insisted on my giving my hand to Lady Dorothea .
Philippa received us both with every expression of affectionate Love .
My arrival was indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been totally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew , but had never even had the slightest idea of there being such a person in the World .
Such perfidious Treachery in the merciless perpetrators of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest Marianne as much as it then affected the Delicate sensibility of Edward , Sophia , your Laura , and of Augustus himself .
`` Where am I to drive ? ''
The death of my Parents a few weeks after my Departure , is the circumstance I allude to .
By their decease I became the lawfull Inheritress of their House and Fortune .
the House had never been their own and their Fortune had only been an Annuity on their own Lives .
To your Mother I should have returned with Pleasure , should have been happy to have introduced to her , my charming Sophia and should with Chearfullness have passed the remainder of my Life in their dear Society in the Vale of Uske , had not one obstacle to the execution of so agreable a scheme , intervened ; which was the Marriage and Removal of your Mother to a distant part of Ireland .
my beloved Laura ( cried Sophia ) for pity 's sake forbear recalling to my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband .
do not I beseech you ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name -- .
It affects me too deeply -- .
I can not bear to hear him mentioned it wounds my feelings . ''
Arm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are Mistress of ; summon up all the fortitude you possess , for alas !
The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost more than my gentle Nature could support , were trifles in comparison to the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate .
The morning after our arrival at the Cottage , Sophia complained of a violent pain in her delicate limbs , accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed it to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the Dew was falling the Evening before .
This I feared was but too probably the case ; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should have escaped the same indisposition , but by supposing that the bodily Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so effectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against the chilling Damps of Night , whereas , Sophia lying totally inactive on the ground must have been exposed to all their severity .
I was most seriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to you , a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me , would in the End be fatal to her .
Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few days carried her off .
I had wept over her every Day -- had bathed her sweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in mine -- .
Though at the time they may be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the end , if too often repeated and at improper seasons , prove destructive to your Constitution ... My fate will teach you this..
When we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his son , he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year .
`` I never can think such tremendous , knock-me-down figures in the least degree elegant , and as for their eyes , they are so tall that I never could strain my neck enough to look at them . ''
LETTER the SEVENTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol the 27th of March
I suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection for each other than Henry and Eloisa ; no , the Love of your Brother for Miss Burton could not be so strong tho ' it might be more violent .
I am sorry to have them go because they are the only family with whom we have here any acquaintance , but I never thought of crying ; to be sure Eloisa and Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me , and have therefore contracted a kind of affection for each other , which does not make Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me .
The Marlowes are going to Town ; Cliveland accompanies them ; as neither Eloisa nor I could catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better Luck .
Things being thus settled between them the King died , and was succeeded by his son Henry who had previously beat Sir William Gascoigne .
His Majesty 's 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk 's Neice who , tho ' universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was beheaded , has been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned life before her Marriage -- of this however I have many doubts , since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the Queen of Scotland 's cause , and who at last fell a victim to it .
`` Yes Ma'am . ''
`` True Ellen , but Candles cost money , and Mrs Williams is too wise to be extravagant . ''
You will think this a good dash of mine my dear Mary , but you know that I am not wanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw .
`` Are you pleased with the Country Miss Grenville ?
Do you find it equal to the one you have left ? ''
`` You are extremely obliging Ma'am -- said she -- and I am highly flattered by your attention to me -- But I am in no difficulty , no doubt , no uncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted .
I found that by the appearance of sentiment and Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to renew my attacks by Questions and suppositions .
My dearest Musgrove -- .
I never read so sweet a Letter in my Life .
How shall we manage to see one another ?
my dear Musgrove you can not think how impatiently I wait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt -- If they will not Die soon , I beleive I shall run mad , for I get more in love with you every day of my Life .
I hope you will be so kind as to write to me again soon , for I never read such sweet Letters as yours .
But why Henrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love , or why refuse to confide in me ? ''
This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened : `` ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL .
`` Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq .
Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot 's character ; vanity of person and of situation .
He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .
His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .
-- She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.
That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation .
For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne .
A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .
He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work .
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost .
It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him .
Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .
For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country .
The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq.
Sir Walter has resented it .
Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house .
Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .
`` There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . ''
I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . ''
what was his name ?
Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty .
But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them .
You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's freckles . ''
I have not seen one of them to-day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me .
could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness !
The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .
Her brother 's return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .
She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .
Eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up .
What might not eight years do ?
It included nearly a third part of her own life .
Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister 's in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound .
`` I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; '' replied Captain Wentworth , seriously .
`` But , Captain Wentworth , '' cried Louisa , `` how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you . ''
`` And so then , I suppose , '' said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , `` so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy .
I always forgot . ''
The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals .
If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?
Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's introduction .
He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father's house , only two miles from Uppercross .
With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon .
But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , `` Oh !
The time now approached for Lady Russell 's return : the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .
Captain Wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .
They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme , as a public place , might offer .
The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger 's eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better .
He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation .
They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but Louisa recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town .
When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way .
Heir to Sir Walter Elliot !
Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes .
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ?
I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me !
When she could command Mary 's attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted .
He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night .
When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . ''
`` Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . ''
I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .
There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time .
Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again .
Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .
She is not satisfied .
Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , `` I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me .
`` Well , she is to marry him .
The character of his manner was embarrassment .
no , that is clear enough .
What a very good-looking man ! ''
`` This , '' said she , `` is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language .
I am a very poor Italian scholar . ''
Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise .
She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain .
He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell .
`` I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , '' she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , `` I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do .
However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character .
Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced .
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold-blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character .
He has no feeling for others .
Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction .
Your kindness almost overpowers me .
At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again .
They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer .
If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion .
`` I can explain this too , '' cried Mrs Smith , smiling .
`` Can you really ? ''
So says my historian , at least .
With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation .
And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .
A'n't I a good boy ?
Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure .
There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement .
There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re-union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting .
And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery-maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest .
All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end .
Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth .
This however was what Lady Russell had now to do .
Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell 's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .
The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .
She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith .
While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two .
She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy .
She gloried in being a sailor 's wife , but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is , if possible , more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance .
You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _you_ .
What a horrible idea !
Her father fondly replied , `` Ah !
my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston 's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
`` Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .
You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .
She means it , I know . ''
`` Not I , indeed .
I only name possibilities .
I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing .
I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .
-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !
what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure !
There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
She would sit whenever I asked her .
There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !
I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet .
Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ; -- there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama 's children ever were .
Then here is my last , '' -- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole-length -- '' my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. John Knightley.
It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ; -- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again .
`` Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted , '' -- observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.
I never saw such a likeness in my life .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know . ''
I 'd rather you would . ''
`` I shall not give you any advice , Harriet .
`` My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . ''
Emma will be happy to entertain you .
`` Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better .
`` Certainly , '' replied he , surprized , `` I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred .
Was not she the whole day with you ? ''
`` Come , '' said she , `` I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .
`` I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , '' said Mr. Knightley presently , `` though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .
Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high .
Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .
He knows the value of a good income as well as any body .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet 's .
Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ?
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment .
It was Garrick 's , you know . ''
And he is a very clever boy , indeed .
They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways .
They will come and stand by my chair , and say , 'Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? '
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much . ''
`` I wish we could contrive it , '' said she ; `` but I can not think of any tolerable pretence for going in ; -- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father . ''
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves . ''
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .
`` But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently . ''
`` A man can not be more so , '' was his short , full answer .
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella 's throat , -- both sea air and bathing . ''
But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself .
I speak as a friend , Emma .
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .
Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . ''
`` We want only two more to be just the right number .
`` And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
`` He may have a great deal of influence on some points , '' continued Mrs. Weston , `` and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . ''
It will be bad enough for the horses . ''
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please . ''
There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill-humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.
-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense ?
To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
`` Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others .
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . ''
`` He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , '' said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry .
replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.
I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .
-- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .
`` I am concerned to hear of it .
Mrs. Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax . ''
`` I am afraid we must be running away , '' said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise -- '' My father will be expecting us .
I merely called , because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates ; but I have been so pleasantly detained !
Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning . ''
And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded .
She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax 's letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . ''
I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed .
The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy .
You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower !
-- We think she is the better for Highbury already .
Thank you , we do indeed .
Good morning to you , my dear sir .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !
-- Good morning to you . ''
How that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration .
The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more .
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
His manner had no air of study or exaggeration .
`` Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .
-- A most deplorable want of complexion . ''
`` You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , '' said Mrs. Weston smiling ; `` remember that I am here.
Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life .
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .
The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls .
The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them .
This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of Mr. Weston .
With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual .
But you will do every thing right .
And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour .
You will get very tired when tea is over . ''
-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away .
-- I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.
`` That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . ''
I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . ''
`` Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
His good-nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match-making .
You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey !
For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . ''
Why should he marry ?
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr. Knightley .
This would be a trial .
If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
`` Are you sure ?
Nobody talked about it .
And I hate Italian singing.
`` They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox .
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . ''
Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement.
`` If you are very kind , '' said he , `` it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ; -- let me live them over again .
You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .
I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half-hour . ''
`` Very true , '' he gravely replied ; `` it was very bad . ''
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
Is not it a good exchange ?
Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . ''
`` You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , '' said Emma .
His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed .
Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than ,
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !
-- It was too wretched !
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say ,
`` Of all horrid things , leave-taking is the worst . ''
`` In short , '' said he , `` perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion '' --
She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; `` but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . ''
`` I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton .
-- Was not it lucky ?
`` Worse than I had supposed .
-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !
A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
I never met with her equal .
what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! ''
Mr. Elton knows you . ''
`` No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected .
More is avowedly due to _her_ .
A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . ''
Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold .
When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect . ''
`` You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , '' he continued -- '' and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . ''
It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings .
The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards .
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .
He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .
She hoped it was not so .
Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
`` And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.
-- Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without .
`` Whom are you going to dance with ? ''
`` Indeed I will .
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . ''
She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .
Her curiosity was greatly excited .
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister .
said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement .
And secretly she added to herself , `` Lord bless me !
I never was equal to this . ''
`` I do remember it , '' cried Emma ; `` I perfectly remember it.
-- Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?
I have an idea he was standing just here . ''
`` Nay , I had it from you .
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined .
She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not tell .
Emma was extremely confused .
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
He found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .
`` I wish we had a donkey .
-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.
-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.
`` No -- I shall not stir .
`` Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self-command .
You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to-day you are got back again -- and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . ''
Some laughed , and answered good-humouredly .
Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct .
`` No , no , '' -- he gravely replied.
`` I do not know.
-- Not Frank ; -- it is not Frank , I assure you .
While poor Mrs. Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ; -- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion . ''
She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming ,
To that point went every leisure moment which her father's claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .
Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . ''
-- How was it to be endured ?
Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,
Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied ,
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions .
Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.
-- I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .
He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .
I have never been attached to him .
`` I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.
`` You will not ask me what is the point of envy.
-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.
Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . ''
-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ; -- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
`` She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children -- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton 's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ? ''
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried .
-- She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
`` I do not know which it ought to be called . ''
`` You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , `` No , this is impossible ! ''
-- You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
You only mean , that he intends it . ''
`` I am perfectly satisfied , '' replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , `` and most sincerely wish them happy . ''
-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.
-- A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.
-- He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation .
Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter's courage failed .
She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed .
`` But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other .
Muslin can never be said to be wasted .
`` Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . ''
Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner .
His name was not in the pump-room book , and curiosity could do no more .
He must be gone from Bath .
This sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine 's imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him .
From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen .
Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion -- but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced .
`` No , indeed , I should not .
I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable .
My dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina 's skeleton behind it . ''
She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ''
`` They are not coming this way , are they ?
`` Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them !
And now , what say you to going to Edgar 's Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ?
You said you should like to see it . ''
This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse .
`` You have lost an hour , '' said Morland ; `` it was only ten o'clock when we came from Tetbury . ''
`` Curricle-hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword-case , splashing-board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron-work as good as new , or better .
`` Neither one nor t'other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ''
`` Upon my honour , '' said James , `` in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . ''
`` Nonsense , how can you say so ?
`` Not expect me !
Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety .
A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe 's saying very abruptly , `` Old Allen is as rich as a Jew -- is not he ? ''
Catherine did not understand him -- and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , `` Old Allen , the man you are with . ''
They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling .
And did they speak to you ? ''
There was not a single point in which we differed ; I would not have had you by for the world ; you are such a sly thing , I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it . ''
`` I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . ''
I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance .
John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . ''
`` Oh , no ; they will never think of me , after such a description as that . ''
`` Only go and call on Mrs .
However , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say .
But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath -- and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . ''
Here their conversation closed , the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention .
`` But is it like what one reads of ? ''
`` Then I should like to see it ; but I can not -- I can not go .
`` Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , '' was the general cry .
Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : `` Well , my dear , '' said she , `` suppose you go . ''
Her assurance , however , standing sole as it did , was not thrown away ; it brought a more cordial , more natural smile into his countenance , and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve : `` We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street : you were so kind as to look back on purpose . ''
The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend -- I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ''
Now , my sweet Catherine , all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have a most delightful party . ''
`` But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade . ''
With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them .
It does for everything .
But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . ''
`` You are fond of history !
Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , `` Indeed !
And of what nature ? ''
`` You speak with astonishing composure !
But I hope your friend 's accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . ''
His manner might sometimes surprise , but his meaning must always be just : and what she did not understand , she was almost as ready to admire , as what she did .
The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next .
That 's honest , by heavens !
Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? '
I say , you will come to Belle 's wedding , I hope . ''
It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me .
My notion of things is simple enough .
Henry smiled , and said , `` How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people 's actions . ''
`` Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ''
The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : `` I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death .
He is such a rattle !
Amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ''
When the young ladies next met , they had a far more interesting subject to discuss .
A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children .
An estate of at least equal value , moreover , was assured as his future inheritance .
The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine 's feelings through the varieties of suspense , security , and disappointment ; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss ; and with spirits elated to rapture , with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter .
This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance .
By the kindness of her first friends , the Allens , she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her .
Her feelings , her preferences , had each known the happiness of a return .
The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister .
The Tilneys , they , by whom , above all , she desired to be favourably thought of , outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued .
She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized -- and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey !
Her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney -- and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill .
Its long , damp passages , its narrow cells and ruined chapel , were to be within her daily reach , and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends , some awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun .
`` No , indeed , I can not . ''
-- You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ''
If I could believe it -- my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . ''
An immense heavy chest !
What can it hold ?
Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight !
I will look into it -- cost me what it may , I will look into it -- and directly too -- by daylight .
She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same .
Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty .
She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a T ; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment .
Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents .
With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence .
This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney 's maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay .
Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest .
Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page .
She started at its import .
Two others , penned by the same hand , marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting , in letters , hair-powder , shoe-string , and breeches-ball .
Such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night 's rest !
She felt humbled to the dust .
Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ?
-- Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all !
It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one .
Did Henry 's income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill-provided for .
The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen 's , as well her father 's , including church-yard and orchard .
If he had a hobby-horse , it was that .
There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his .
The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year .
Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ''
`` And ought it not , '' reflected Catherine , `` to endear it to her husband ?
Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion .
She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour .
`` It remains as it was , I suppose ? ''
In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman 's confinement -- might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ?
In the high-arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account .
It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine 's curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp .
`` How came I up that staircase ! ''
he replied , greatly surprised .
`` Because it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ''
`` No , I was not .
No ; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday -- and we were coming here to these rooms -- but only '' -- dropping her voice -- '' your father was with us . ''
`` It is only a quarter past four '' showing his watch -- '' and you are not now in Bath .
Her dying so suddenly '' ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , `` and you -- none of you being at home -- and your father , I thought -- perhaps had not been very fond of her . ''
But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad .
James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .
But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it !
I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again .
You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned .
I am undeceived in time !
But it is a heavy blow !
After my father 's consent had been so kindly given -- but no more of this .
She has made me miserable forever !
Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much .
Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears .
I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland's disappointment .
His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable .
I think you must be deceived so far .
Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement , and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it .
The general , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick's remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland 's time at Northanger pass pleasantly .
I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ''
`` Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther .
If you think it long -- ''
Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her .
His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the general loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her `` Your Ladyship ! ''
Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add -- aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable -- that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures .
He means to send for his horses immediately , and it is impossible to say when you may see him in Kent .
I will not disguise my sentiments on this change from you , my dear mother , though I think you had better not communicate them to my father , whose excessive anxiety about Reginald would subject him to an alarm which might seriously affect his health and spirits .
His admiration was at first very strong , but no more than was natural , and I did not wonder at his being much struck by the gentleness and delicacy of her manners ; but when he has mentioned her of late it has been in terms of more extraordinary praise ; and yesterday he actually said that he could not be surprised at any effect produced on the heart of man by such loveliness and such abilities ; and when I lamented , in reply , the badness of her disposition , he observed that whatever might have been her errors they were to be imputed to her neglected education and early marriage , and that she was altogether a wonderful woman .
Our prospect is most delightful , and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn , I am quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you ; for the pleasure of learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased by all that you have previously suffered .
I am going to send James forward with my hunters immediately ; if you have any letter , therefore , he can take it .
Be assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the truth of what I say ; I Know that Frederica is made wretched by Sir James 's continuing here .
I concluded , of course , that she and Reginald had been quarrelling ; and looked with anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face .
Young men are often hasty in their resolutions , and not more sudden in forming than unsteady in keeping them .
I should not be surprised if he were to change his mind at last , and not go . ''
She soon afterwards left the room .
They must have quarrelled , and about Frederica , too .
When I next write I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone , Lady Susan vanquished , and Frederica at peace .
I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change was effected .
I have a real regard for him , and was beyond expression mortified to find it , as I thought , so ill bestowed We were both warm , and of course both to blame .
I have now only to say further , that as I am convinced of Frederica 's having a reasonable dislike to Sir James , I shall instantly inform him that he must give up all hope of her .
I reproach myself for having even , though innocently , made her unhappy on that score .
She shall have all the retribution in my power to make ; if she value her own happiness as much as I do , if she judge wisely , and command herself as she ought , she may now be easy .
In spite of this release , Frederica still looks unhappy : still fearful , perhaps , of her mother 's anger ; and though dreading my brother 's departure , jealous , it may be , of his staying .
He is more securely hers than ever .
MR. DE COURCY TO LADY SUSAN
LADY SUSAN TO MR. DE COURCY
I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power .
I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries .
Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else . ''
And sitting down by her , he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised , and persuade her to speak openly .
or was anybody angry with her ?
Did she , in short , want anything he could possibly get her , or do for her ?
For a long while no answer could be obtained beyond a `` no , no -- not at all -- no , thank you '' ; but he still persevered ; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home , than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay .
`` You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , '' said he , `` which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy .
Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ''
I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet .
How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! ''
She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister .
Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls , she would probably have supposed it unnecessary , for they were under the care of a governess , with proper masters , and could want nothing more .
Kept back as she was by everybody else , his single support could not bring her forward ; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind , and extending its pleasures .
Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves .
I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral 's lessons have quite spoiled him . ''
I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse .
It would save me many a heartache . ''
My cousin is grown up .
`` Well , and if they were _ten_ , '' cried Mrs. Norris , `` I am sure _you_ need not regard it .
For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it .
We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it .
You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris 's sad state of health .
It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris 's death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , '' addressing herself then to Dr. Grant .
`` _You_ can never want employment .
I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . ''
`` My dear Miss Price , '' said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , `` I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself -- I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me .
Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter .
how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ''
Miss Bertram , displeased with her sister , led the way , and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough .
The lawn , bounded on each side by a high wall , contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green , and beyond the bowling-green a long terrace walk , backed by iron palisades , and commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining .
It was a good spot for fault-finding .
The politeness which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape ; while the want of that higher species of self-command , that just consideration of others , that knowledge of her own heart , that principle of right , which had not formed any essential part of her education , made her miserable under it .
One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ?
`` It is an immense distance , '' said she ; `` I see _that_ with a glance . ''
Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side , she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before , and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation .
Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful .
'I can not get out , ' as the starling said . ''
As she spoke , and it was with expression , she walked to the gate : he followed her .
said Maria , half-pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented .
`` It is fortunate that your inclination and your father 's convenience should accord so well .
An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl .
And so saying , she walked hastily out of the room , leaving awkward feelings to more than one , but exciting small compassion in any except Fanny , who had been a quiet auditor of the whole , and who could not think of her as under the agitations of _jealousy_ without great pity .
A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers ' Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates 's help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary -- while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under-voice , and the declaration with which she began of , `` I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse , '' was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for .
He went ; but there was no reading , no China , no composure for Fanny .
After all his objections -- objections so just and so public !
Could it be possible ?
She had seen her influence in every speech , and was miserable .
The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct , which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him , were become of little consequence now .
This deeper anxiety swallowed them up .
Things should take their course ; she cared not how it ended .
She was beyond their reach ; and if at last obliged to yield -- no matter -- it was all misery now .
you have never told me . ''
My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . ''
He too had his book , and was seeking Fanny , to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house ; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together , of comparing schemes , and sympathising in praise of Fanny 's kind offices .
Mr. Yates was still talking .
We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole .
do n't talk so , do n't talk so , '' cried Fanny , distressed by more feelings than he was aware of ; but seeing that she was distressed , he had done with the subject , and only added more seriously --
`` That is impossible , Fanny .
He can not much longer deceive himself .
I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ''
Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card-table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress .
The bride was elegantly dressed ; the two bridesmaids were duly inferior ; her father gave her away ; her mother stood with salts in her hand , expecting to be agitated ; her aunt tried to cry ; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant .
Not only at home did her value increase , but at the Parsonage too .
`` My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul 's , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be .
But we have no such people in Mansfield .
What would you have me do ? ''
`` But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ''
Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back .
Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . ''
Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ''
You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . ''
only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again .
She had a letter from him herself , a few hurried happy lines , written as the ship came up Channel , and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead ; and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand , which he had hoped would bring the first tidings , he found her trembling with joy over this letter , and listening with a glowing , grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply .
His recitals were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas , but the chief object in seeking them was to understand the reciter , to know the young man by his histories ; and he listened to his clear , simple , spirited details with full satisfaction , seeing in them the proof of good principles , professional knowledge , energy , courage , and cheerfulness , everything that could deserve or promise well .
Young as he was , William had already seen a great deal .
`` His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less .
Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him .
`` This is the assembly night , '' said William .
`` I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny .
But , on the contrary , it was no worse than , `` I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question .
I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ''
William 's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary impression on his uncle .
He remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling ; to gratify anybody else who might wish to see Fanny dance , and to give pleasure to the young people in general ; and having thought the matter over , and taken his resolution in quiet independence , the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast , when , after recalling and commending what his nephew had said , he added , `` I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence .
It would give me pleasure to see you both dance .
Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now .
I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball .
But Miss Crawford persevered , and argued the case with so much affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross , and the ball , and herself , as to be finally successful .
Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation ; and hastened to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her , and making her see how well it looked .
it must not be !
or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ?
or perhaps '' -- looking archly -- '' you suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? ''
It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford 's change of manners .
`` She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother 's gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it .
No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . ''
But the other : the first !
He would marry Miss Crawford .
But he was deceived in her : he gave her merits which she had not ; her faults were what they had ever been , but he saw them no longer .
Till she had shed many tears over this deception , Fanny could not subdue her agitation ; and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness .
To her , the handwriting itself , independent of anything it may convey , is a blessedness .
Never were such characters cut by any other human being as Edmund 's commonest handwriting gave !
For Fanny 's present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford 's faults and his own despondence .
But as it was , they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection , and with some very precious sensations on hers .
Now everything was smiling .
Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in Edmund 's cheerfulness , but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully made .
`` I am worn out with civility , '' said he .
Let us have the luxury of silence . ''
`` Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of .
`` I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines .
But go on , go on .
What are your plans ?
Does she know her own happiness ? ''
Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed .
`` Had you seen her this morning , Mary , '' he continued , `` attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt's stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman 's service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _me_ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said .
`` I am glad you gave him something considerable , '' said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , `` for _I_ gave him only 10 . ''
Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise .
Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining ; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt Norris .
Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford .
Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so selfish and ungenerous .
Had her own affections been as free as perhaps they ought to have been , he never could have engaged them .
He then saw Mr. Crawford , and received his account .
Mr. Crawford 's steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world .
Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ''
Fanny suspected what was going on .
Crawford called the next day , and on the score of Edmund 's return , Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner ; it was really a necessary compliment .
Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford 's character in that point .
`` This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it .
`` Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . ''
`` You were near staying there ? ''
His objections , the scruples of his integrity , seemed all done away , nobody could tell how ; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally got over -- and equally without apparent reason .
Her acceptance must be as certain as his offer ; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her , independently , she believed , independently of self .
Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end .
She had heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which had passed since their leaving Mansfield , and in each letter there had been a few lines from himself , warm and determined like his speeches .
It was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared .
In every argument with her mother , Susan had in point of reason the advantage , and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off .
The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known .
By sitting together upstairs , they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house ; Fanny had peace , and Susan learned to think it no misfortune to be quietly employed .
It was the only point of resemblance .
By degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs , at first only in working and talking , but after a few days , the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found it impossible not to try for books again .
There were none in her father's house ; but wealth is luxurious and daring , and some of hers found its way to a circulating library .
She became a subscriber ; amazed at being anything _in propria persona_ , amazed at her own doings in every way , to be a renter , a chuser of books !
But so it was .
By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
This was towards the close of their walk .
He attended them to the last , and left them only at the door of their own house , when he knew them to be going to dinner , and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere .
I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon .
I must come to an understanding with him .
The mischief such a man does on an estate , both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor , is inconceivable .
I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly , and put everything at once on such a footing as can not be afterwards swerved from .
Maddison is a clever fellow ; I do not wish to displace him , provided he does not try to displace _me_ ; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me , and worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted , griping fellow for a tenant , instead of an honest man , to whom I have given half a promise already .
She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended .
`` I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , '' was Fanny 's secret declaration as she finished this .
How shall I bear it ?
An attachment , originally as tranquil as their tempers , was now become a mere name .
Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price .
When she had been coming to Portsmouth , she had loved to call it her home , had been fond of saying that she was going home ; the word had been very dear to her , and so it still was , but it must be applied to Mansfield .
_That_ was now the home .
Still , however , it was her private regale .
It was always : `` When I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . ''
For a great while it was so , but at last the longing grew stronger , it overthrew caution , and she found herself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was aware .
She need not have been uneasy .
Be assured he cares for nobody but you .
He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park .
The next day came and brought no second letter .
She could still think of little else all the morning ; but , when her father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual , she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head .
There '' ( holding out the paper to her ) ; `` much good may such fine relations do you .
Employment , even melancholy , may dispel melancholy , and her occupations were hopeful .
She had so much to do , that not even the horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth -- now fixed to the last point of certainty could affect her as it had done before .
She had not time to be miserable .
Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone ; her father and mother must be spoken to , Susan prepared , everything got ready .
He turned away to recover himself , and when he spoke again , though his voice still faltered , his manner shewed the wish of self-command , and the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion .
`` Have you breakfasted ?
were questions following each other rapidly .
When Mansfield was considered , time was precious ; and the state of his own mind made him find relief only in motion .
Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour .
He looked very ill ; evidently suffering under violent emotions , which he was determined to suppress .
What was to be inferred ?
This must be his state .
He yielded , but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech .
Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford 's name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been .
She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure .
She had sources of delight that must force their way .
She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford .
He was suffering from disappointment and regret , grieving over what was , and wishing for what could never be .
She loved him ; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her .
Secrecy could not have been more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth 's credit than he felt it for his own .
When he returned from Richmond , he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more .
