`` War Departments ; that 's more like it . ''
Real , workable , flying machines .
I tell you , sir , a foreigner , or , for the matter of that , an unaccredited native , ca n't get within four miles of Lydd nowadays -- not to mention our little circus at Aldershot , and the experimental camp in Galway .
`` Well , '' said Bert , `` I 'd like to see one of them , anyhow .
I 'll believe when I see , that I 'll promise you . ''
When they really came to take the place they remembered this conversation .
Hens , however , were out of the question ; there was no place for a run unless they had it in the shop .
`` Sooner or later , '' said Bert , `` we shall get a motor-car through this . ''
`` We want to forget things -- and cut all these rotten old worries .
And , in , addition there were some rather under-exposed photographs , obviously done by an amateur , at close quarters , of the actual machine's mutterings had made , in its shed near the Crystal Palace .
`` Lord '' he said , `` here am I and the whole blessed secret of flying -- lost up here on the roof of everywhere .
He pierced the bottom with the key provided in the holes indicated , and forthwith the can grew from cold to hotter and hotter , until at last he could scarcely touch it , and then he opened the can at the other end , and there was his cocoa smoking , without the use of match or flame of any sort .
Each one seemed as long as the Strand , and as big about as Trafalgar Square .
It flashed into his head , as he cowered in the bottom of the car , that he might avoid all sorts of disagreeable and complicated explanations by pretending to be mad .
`` What a lark ! ''
What a thundering lark !
You 're on the blessed old flagship with the Prince .
You wo n't miss anything .
Whatever 's on , you bet the Vaterland will be there . ''
If he worked it right !
It was worth trying , anyhow .
He learnt it at last from Kurt .
He walked about the swinging cabin , and for a time he was wholly German .
`` Pup-pup-pup '' went a gun somewhere in the mirk ahead and suddenly and quite horribly the Vaterland lurched , and Bert and the sentinel were clinging to the rail for dear life .
The rail went right overhead , and he was hanging loose in the air holding on to it .
The effect of that evening was to linger long in Bert 's memory .
The Prince sat on a rock close by , with his chin on his hand , waiting .
Beyond and to the northward was the cairn that covered Von Winterfeld , surmounted by a cross of steel , and from among the tumbled rocks in the distance the eyes of a wolf gleamed redly .
On the other hand was the wreckage of the great airship and the men bivouacked about a second ruddy flare .
`` Did they do much to London , sir ? ''
`` I know , '' he repeated , and for a time they walked in silence towards the waterfall .
The sort of thing the English did at Alexandria , the Japanese at Port Arthur , the French at Casablanca , is going on everywhere .
No place is safe -- no place is at peace .
Quiet people go out in the morning , and see air-fleets passing overhead -- dripping death -- dripping death ! ''
Perhaps a hundred yards above the water , out of the south , riding like Valkyries swiftly through the air on the strange steeds the engineering of Europe had begotten upon the artistic inspiration of Japan , came a long string of Asiatic swordsman .
The wings flapped jerkily , click , block , clitter clock , and the machines drove up ; they spread and ceased , and the apparatus came soaring through the air .
So they rose and fell and rose again .
They swooped towards Niagara city and landed one after another in a long line in a clear space before the hotel .
Remote over Canada receded the rest of that conflict and vanished beyond the range of his vision ... .
`` Ought to be somethin ' -- ''
`` I do wish 'e wasn't there ! ''
Bert was struck with an exasperating afterthought .
But the Germans were already out of sight , and no doubt taking cover among the trees .
He had finished that up and handed its gleanings to the kitten and he was falling-to on the second plateful , when the plate broke in his hand !
He stared , with the fact slowly creeping upon him that an instant before he had heard a crack among the thickets .
Then he sprang to his feet , snatched up his gun in one hand and the tin of corned beef in the other , and fled round the shed to the other side of the clearing .
As he did so came a second crack from the thickets , and something went phwit !
All 'e tole me was that I got a weak chess .
They turned from one little aspect to another .
Everywhere levies were being formed at that time to defend the plant of the railroads day and night in the hope that communication would speedily be restored .
The land war was still far away .
The man with the flat voice talked on , without heeding him , of the strange irony of Butteridge 's death .
It appeared Butteridge had died suddenly , very suddenly .
A memory of epithets pricked him .
She seemed to hesitate on the verge of some answer and not to say it .
The white-faced gentleman descended , relieved himself tediously of the vast fur coat , handed it to Clarence and turned to the house .
Still the protesting mind of Mr. Brumley refused to believe !
He tried to make it appear almost as if houses like this often happened to him , and interested him only in the most incidental manner .
They had their proper price , he tried to convey , which of course no gentleman would underbid .
`` It might n't be so bad , '' said Sir Isaac , and whistled a little between his teeth .
`` A minimum , '' said Mr. Brumley , with a slight quickening of the pulse .
His face expressed a panic terror of this gallant full-rigged lady ahead of them .
`` Your Chicks , '' expanded Lady Beach-Mandarin , on the verge of crooning .
I saw a sort of gardener -- -- ''
As they hummed through the West-End afternoon Ellen became aware that he was whistling through his teeth .
The fortunate girl-wife went on through Brompton to Walham Green with a stunned feeling .
His knighthood followed almost automatically .
What becomes of the people if they do get hurt ? ''
`` About Sir Markham 's newspaper symposium .
`` I met -- some people .
I met Agatha Alimony .
`` He went on -- dreadfully . ''
`` If I went into a pawnshop near here , '' she said , `` it would seem so odd ... .
This ring , Susan , must be worth thirty or forty pounds .
`` Not my affair -- seemingly , '' said Sir Isaac with irony .
It has been said , I think , by Limburger , in his already cited work , that nothing so excites and prevails with woman as rapid and extensive violence , sparing and yet centring upon herself , and certainly it has to be recorded that , so far from being merely indignant , and otherwise a helplessly pathetic spectacle , Lady Harman found , though perhaps she did not go quite so far as to admit to herself that she found , this vehement flight from the social , moral , and intellectual contaminations of London an experience not merely stimulating but entertaining .
The image of Black Strand as , after all , a very pleasant place indeed returned to her .
`` I wo n't stand it , '' she repeated .
More than you do for your husband ?
`` _I ca n't imagine_ , '' whispered Lady Harman , `` _anything_ -- -- '' And left her sentence unfinished .
Her indignation was profound .
Even then , things must have been hanging over him ... .
If girls were paid properly there would n't be any need of such places , none at all .
Suppose this sort of thing grows up all over the place , it 'll just be the story of the little bakers and little grocers and all those people over again .
Why in London there are thousands of people just keep a home together by letting two or three rooms or boarding someone -- and it stands to reason , they'll have to take less or lose the lodgers if this kind of thing 's going to be done .
_Now_ -- -- You make me feel as though someone had put the wheel of a motor car in my hand , started it and told me to steer ... . ''
While Lady Harman was slowly accustoming her mind to this idea that the development of those Hostels was her appointed career in life , so far as a wife may have a career outside her connubial duties , and while she was getting insensibly to believe in Mr. Brumley 's theory of their exemplary social importance , the Hostels themselves with a haste that she felt constantly was premature , were achieving a concrete existence .
Sir Isaac had sound Victorian ideas about the place of literature in life .
If anyone had suggested to him that literature could supply ideas to practical men he would have had a choking fit , and he regarded Mr. Brumley 's sedulous attentions to these hostel schemes with feelings , the kindlier elements of whose admixture was a belief that ultimately he would write some elegant and respectful approval of the established undertaking .
Sir Isaac 's hand tightened on the arm of his chair .
`` I started 'em to please you , '' he said .
`` I did n't start 'em to please your friends . ''
`` Very well , '' said Sir Isaac and reflected and made his old familiar sound with his teeth .
`` Then I 'll believe . ''
`` Doctor Greve ! ''
If now the hostels were to be wrenched out of her hands , if at her husband 's death she was to be stripped of every possession and left a helpless dependant on her own children , if for all her good behaviour she was to be insulted by his frantic suspicions so long as he lived and then disgraced by his posthumous mistrust ; was there any reason why she should go on standing anything any more ?
How good it was to have a friend !
How good it was to have even one single friend !
-- He paused and then went on , speaking apparently to the array of black tin boxes in the dingy fixtures before him .
That 's what I always ask in these cases .
Unless the lady goes and does things right under the noses of these trustees they are n't going to bother .
You said something ? ''
He flung off his surrenders as a savage might fling off a garment .
Then she said once more , and very gently --
_With frontispiece in colors by F. Graham Cootes .
And then it seemed to Fred that a little miracle happened .
His father vanished from his sight with an expression of astonishment just forming on his face and reappeared beside him , so far as back and legs are concerned , holding on to the ladder with a sort of death grip .
`` That he ca n't prove it . ''
Mrs. Bunting left an eloquent pause .
`` Has Miss Glendower ? ''
`` Because we are permitted to come -- we immortals .
And why , if we choose to do so , and taste this life that passes and continues , as rain that falls to the ground , why should we not do it ?
Was there not some more plausible interpretation , some phrase that would lie out bridgeways from the plausible to the truth ?
_I_ could n't get up emotion as they do , if my feet were being flayed .
`` It amuses me , '' said Fred Bunting .
Does _he_ know -- -- ''
`` There are times , '' she said , `` when it seems to me that my love for him is altogether dead ... .
He buys clothes of shoddy and boots of brown paper .
His newspapers , which are supported by advertisers and financiers , in order to hide the obvious injustice of this one-man-fight against the allied forces of property , din in his ears that his one grievance is local taxation , his one remedy `` to keep down the rates '' -- the `` rates '' which do at least repair his roadway , police his streets , give him open spaces for his babies and help to educate his children , and which , moreover , constitute a burthen he might by a little intelligent political action shift quite easily from his own shoulders to the broad support of capital and land .
Self-interest never took a man or a community to any other end than damnation .
For all services there is necessary a code of honour and devotion which a man must set up for himself and obey , to which he must subordinate a number of his impulses .
It is little marvel that under the typical eighteenth century monarchy , when the way to ship , regiment and the apostolic succession alike lay through the ante-chamber of the king 's mistress , there was begotten that absolute repudiation of State Control to which Herbert Spencer was destined at last to give the complete expression , that irrational , passionate belief that whatever else is right the State is necessarily incompetent and wrong ... .
To any person with a philosophical education this is a ridiculous mental process , but it seems perfectly rational to an untrained mind -- and that is the usual case with the Anti-Socialist .
In my preceding chapters I hope I have made it clear that `` property '' even to-day is a very qualified and uncertain thing , a natural vague instinct capable of perversion and morbid exaggeration and needing control , and that Socialism seeks simply to give it a sharper , juster and rationally limited form in relation to the common-weal .
The rent will do under Socialism what the rates do now .
Rates for public purposes are necessary to-day because the landowners of the world evade the public obligations that should , in common sense , go with the rent .
None the less it remains true that under existing political conditions it is to the Labour Party that the Socialist must look for the mass and emotion and driving force of political Socialism .
The two other traditional parties in British politics are no doubt undergoing remarkable changes and internal disruptions , and the constructive spirit of the time is at work within them ; but it does not seem that either is likely to develop anything nearly so definitely a Socialist programme as the Labour Party .
Directly one accepts those great generalizations one passes on to a jungle of incurably intricate problems , through which man has to make his way or fail , the riddles and inconsistencies of human character , the puzzles of collective action , the power and decay of traditions , the perpetually recurring tasks and problems of education .
Here and in this manner , says Socialism , a palace and safety and great happiness may be made for mankind .
But it seems to me the Socialist as he turns his hand and way of living towards that common end knows little of the nature of his task if he does so with any but a lively sense of his individual weakness and the need of charity for all that he achieves .
There they are , and the world is theirs . ''
`` You must admit , my dear Dodd -- -- '' began Boon .
`` But you see how relentlessly it follows from the supposition that the novel is a work of art aiming at pictorial unities !
Some of Boon 's jokes about this train were , to say the best of them , obvious .
Lowes Dickinson has just the qualities that take the American judgement ; he carries the shadow of King's College Chapel about with him wherever he goes ; he has an unobtrusive air of being doubly starred in Baedeker and not thinking anything of it .
But after these scrappy notes about Jealousy and how people protect their minds against ideas , and especially the idea which is God , and against the mental intrusions of their fellow-creatures conveying ideas , I understand better the purport of that uninvited society , which he declared insisted upon coming to the Great Conference upon the Mind of the Race , and which held such enthusiastic and crowded meetings that at last it swamped all the rest of the enterprise .
It was , he declared , to the bitter offence of Dodd , a society with very much the same attitude towards all impersonal mental activities that the Rationalist Press Association has to Religion , and it was called the Royal Society for the Discouragement of Literature .
Is this what exists and goes on ?
We people who sit in studies and put in whole hours of our days thinking and joining things together do get a kind of coherence into our ideas about the world .
What was really going on was the gathering up of the Macedonian power to smash through Greece , and then make Greece conquer Asia .
This dragging of his will into a question of fact showed , I think , the beginning of his irritation .
Boon 's eye had something of the expression of a man who watches another ride his favourite horse .
He did not answer immediately .
Then he said : `` Miss Skelton , the Judgement of God is close at hand ! ''
`` Coal , sir . ''
For you see , if he was right and Redwood was right , then by injecting or administering this new substance of his in food , he would do away with the `` resting phase , '' and instead of growth going on in this fashion ,
`` You don't want to run thith Farm for profit .
_ '' said Cousin Jane .
The pace that chick must have grown at -- ! ''
shrieked the hindmost hen , hit smartly by the watering-can Mr. Skelmersdale had thrown , and fluttered wildly over Mrs .
`` Full moon , '' said the electrician .
`` I looked it up . ''
_Bang_ and a _diminuendo_ of echoes .
We 've bagged another of the rats ! ''
`` But his gun -- - ? ''
`` I want him to be _like_ other children , neither smaller nor bigger .
I wanted him to be a nice little boy , just as Georgina Phyllis is a nice little girl , and I wanted to bring him up nicely in a nice way , and here he is '' -- and the unfortunate woman 's voice broke -- '' wearing number four grown-up shoes and being wheeled about by -- booboo !
He looked up his Sowerby to see if it was _Lycoperdon coelatum_ or _giganteum_ -- like all his kind since Gilbert White became famous , he Gilbert-Whited .
Suppose a mere lapse into disrespect -- !
However , the truly brave man is not the man who does not feel fear but the man who overcomes it .
And he used always to address young Caddles stoutly in a good clear service tenor .
But soon the Food was to enter upon a new phase of its work in him .
Water voles came out over the country and did infinite havoc , and one day a farmer caught his pigs drinking there , and instantly and with great presence of mind -- for he knew : of the great hog of Oakham -- slew them all .
And so the whole trouble came out .
With such events that interminable momentous morning lengthened out .
He could add nothing to interpret or enlarge that mystery except that presently there came a reddish fluctuating brightness in the sky towards the south-east .
Redwood gave a note of denial .
`` It 's true , Sir .
What else indeed was life but that -- always to be a prisoner locked in !
He would wake through bloodshed and battle , to find his Food the most foolish of fancies , and his hopes and faith of a greater world to come no more than the coloured film upon a pool of bottomless decay .
The British shipowners , in particular , are reaping enormous but precarious profits from the war .
With an urgent need of every ship for the national supplies , British ships , at the present moment of writing this , are still carrying cheap American automobiles to Australia .
I do not think one can count on any limit to their selfishness and treason .
There will be no end until these profit-makings are arrested .
The necessary `` conscriptions of property '' must come about in Great Britain because there is no alternative but failure in the war , and the British people will not stand failure .
We live in a world of improvised State factories , commandeered railways , substituted labour and emergency arrangements .
French and German in the case of the English , and English in the case of the French and Russians , are essentially governess languages ; any intelligent boy or girl from a reasonably prosperous home ought to be able to read , write , and speak either before fifteen ; they are to be taken by the way rather than regarded as a fundamental part of education .
The French , German , or English literature and literary development up to and including contemporary work is , of course , an entirely different matter .
We begin to perceive in the retrospect that the movement was multiple , made up of a number of very different movements interwoven .
Some , for example , alleged that it was because they were like men , and some because they were entirely different .
What had brought that about ?
And it was not merely the self-reliant , independence-seeking women who were discontented .
They found they were not important enough .
The two mingled their voices in the most confusing way in the literature of the suffrage movement before the war .
The two tendencies mingle confusingly in the minds of the women that this movement was stirring up to think .
The Vote became the symbol for absolutely contradictory things ; there is scarcely a single argument for it in suffragist literature that can not be completely negatived out of suffragist literature .
So far from a great number of men becoming polygamists , I think it would be possible to show cause for supposing that an increasing proportion will cease even to be monogamists .
The romantic excitements of the war have produced a temporary rise in the British marriage rate ; but before the war it had been falling slowly and the average age at marriage had been rising , and it is quite possible that this process will be presently resumed and , as a new generation grows up to restore the balance of the sexes , accelerated .
From any close sympathy with Germany the Americans are cut off at present by the Hohenzollerns and the system of ideas that the Hohenzollerns have imposed upon German thought .
We may bring ourselves to understand , we may bring ourselves to a cold and reasonable forgiveness , we may suppress our Sir George Makgills and so forth , but it will take sixty or seventy years for the two sides in this present war to grow kindly again .
These hatreds can die out only in one way , by the passing of a generation , by the dying out of the wounded and the wronged .
Our business , our unsentimental business , is to set about establishing such conditions that they will so die out .
Behind the barriers this war will have set up between Germany and Anti-Germany , the intelligent men in either camp must prepare the ultimate peace they will never enjoy , must work for the days when their sons at least may meet as they themselves can never meet , without accusation or resentment , upon the common business of the World Peace .
He stared again into the fire .
His emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time .
I prepared to resume reading , and that seemed to precipitate his next remark .
`` He said it was a trivial matter , or at least a dry matter , for a lady to hear .
`` 'What have I to do with these things now ? '
Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here ? '
He was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story .
he said , putting his hand on hers .
His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted , and then back to the woman .
There was another pause .
He let go , and before Raut was aware of it , they were arm in arm , and walking , one unwillingly enough , down the path .
And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace , Raut's doubts came upon him again .
Do what he would , he could not resist a violent trembling .
It was a dangerous place .
They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the place .
Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane nine in the evening , and thereafter , having some inkling of a headache , I was disinclined either for entertainment or further work .
Beyond comparison the night is the best time for this place ; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the waters , and the lights of this transitional age , red glaring orange , gas-yellow , and electric white , are set in shadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep purple .
Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the Embankment , and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster , warm grey against the starlight .
`` You seem to know something of this kind of thing .
Perhaps then you may think better of the purchase . ''
He turned round with his back to the river , and put his hands in his pockets .
He expected dire punishments , but these blind people were capable of toleration .
`` William , ma'am , '' said Jane one day suddenly , with ill-concealed complacency , as she counted out the beer bottles , `` William , ma'am , is a teetotaller .
Yes , m 'm ; and he do n't smoke .
Raut glanced at him and away again .
`` At present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe , '' he continued , looking upward ; `` the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight . ''
He stood up , and releasing the glass slip from the microscope , held it in his hand towards the window .
`` However , I came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out .
I was naturally chary of clambering up into it .
He seemed to be lying cuddled up in a lump in the bows , and the stern was all out of water .
The thing kept turning round slowly as it drifted -- -kind of waltzing , do n't you know .
I went to the stern and pulled it down , expecting him to wake up .
`` This curved and twisting line is the river -- I could do with a drink now !
-- and this star is the place . ''
I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches , and had a doubt of which landing my room might be on .
Now , from the outset , this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon Mr. Cave .
And it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do , that he told no human being of his curious observations .
But the use of an old velvet cloth , which he used as a background for a collection of minerals , occurred to him , and by doubling this , and putting it over his head and hands , he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the day-time .
He was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife , and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons , while she was asleep upstairs , and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter .
And one day , turning the crystal about in his hands , he saw something .
And where was this other world ?
After sunset , the sky darkened rapidly -- there was a very brief twilight interval indeed -- and the stars shone out .
_ `` like our moon but smaller , and quite differently marked , '' one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it .
And all this answers quite completely , although Mr. Cave did not know it , to what must be the condition of things on Mars .
One or two of these niggers cut and run , the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their brains out on the ground .
It was evident they took me for something immense .
He glanced over his shoulder and stopped .
He said `` Demn ! ''
She looked and saw his friend Leonard advancing .
`` It 's over . ''
So far as I know the language , the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious .
I lit a cigar .
`` Will you tell me how much all this comes to ?
So we two went on our way in great happiness . ''
He looked at me thoughtfully , `` Of course I did n't know then that it would n't always be there .
Schoolboys have limited imaginations .
I suppose I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there , to know my way back to it , but there was the school tugging at me .
`` A boy is a creature of odd feelings .
I was , I really believe , in spite of my secret self-disgust , a little flattered to have the attention of these big fellows .
I had bad times after that -- crying at night and wool-gathering by day .
It was _you_ -- your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the grind again . ''
He did not turn aside as he had meant to do , but went on , and passed through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks , and his eyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow .
And the buttons in their newness shone like stars .
Just to wear it !
You do n't think she will want me to marry her , do you ?
Besides , she told me some time ago that she did not intend to marry again .
Think of going love-making , or addressing a public meeting , or dying gloriously , in a nose like mine !
There were at the last thirty-five tons of it in the inner chamber .
Within a month things had been so tidied up , and secured by further excavations and sandbags against hostile fire , that even a middle-aged English writer , extremely fagged and hot and breathless , could enjoy the same privilege .
There was only one good point about the Austrian thrust .
The Italian posts were then in Austrian territory ; they held on the left wing and the right , but they were driven by the sheer weight of men and guns in the centre ; they lost guns and prisoners because of the difficulty of mountain retreats to which I have alluded , and the Austrians pouring through reached not indeed the plain of Venetia , but to the upland valleys immediately above it , to Asiago and Arsiero .
On the hills beyond Schio I walked out through the embrasure of a big gun in a rock gallery , and saw the highest points upon the hillside to which the Austrian infantry clambered in their futile last attacks .
`` It was in the Rue de la Bueire , M'sieur , '' the little maid asserted with quiet conviction , poising the trophy of confectionery for Madame Huard with an unshaking hand .
If it comes to a house or a tree or a wall or such-like obstruction it rams against it so as to bring all its weight to bear upon it -- it weighs _some_ tons -- and then climbs over the debris .
`` To you , '' I said , `` it bears itself with an appearance of faintly hostile , faintly contemptuous apathy .
I found myself talking with something in my voice curiously reminiscent of those liberal Russians who set themselves to explain the contrasts and contradictions of `` official '' Russia and `` true '' Russia . )
If the inner set is so close knit as to seem like a conspiracy , the outer set is so loosely knit as to seem like a noisy confusion .
It has quite other ambitions for the ending of the war than some haggled treaty of alliance with France and Italy ; some advantage that will invalidate German competition ; it begins to realise newer and wider sympathies , possibilities of an amalgamation of interests and community of aim that is utterly beyond the habits of the old oligarchy to conceive , beyond the scope of that tawdry word 'Empire ' to express ... . ''
Of course the war is being largely paid for immediately out of the accumulated private wealth of the past .
This is not in itself an impoverishment of the community .
The wealth of individuals is not the wealth of nations ; the two things may easily be contradictory when the rich man 's wealth consists of land or natural resources or franchises or privileges the use of which he reluctantly yields for high prices .
And what is happening in all the belligerent countries is the taking over of more and more of the realities of wealth from private hands and , in exchange , the contracting of great masses of debt to private people .
From the point of view of the state , and disregarding material and moral damages , that annual interest is the annual instalment of the price to be paid for the war .
Who 'd _let_ 'em ? ''
The blind man thrusts his seeking hands into the oddest corners , he clutches at chairs and curtains , but at last he must surely find and hold and feel over and guess the name of the plainly visible quarry .
`` I doubt if he would have premeditated as much , '' said Warming .
`` Many years ! ''
Graham repeated the words .
He had been prepared to hear of a vast repose , and yet these concrete centuries defeated him .
said the man in red in a resolute voice .
He was being dragged away .
Marvelling and confused , feeling an impotent desire to resist , Graham was half led , half thrust , along the passage of blue pillars , and suddenly he found himself alone with Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward .
A flash of laughter came with the recognition .
he exclaimed , `` and make him take me out to lunch ! ''
He forgot everything else , and sat down in the chair .
But in a little while he knew those two people like intimate friends .
His imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him .
`` Why should anything be done to me ? ''
`` We want -- I ca n't hold the thing .
We have been trying to find a way to you these three days . ''
Graham saw the latter start back , gesticulate to them to conceal themselves , and move as if to hide behind the opening door .
`` Men are strange , '' said the old man .
`` The strange , thing to me is how the Council worked together so long .
But they worked in cliques from the first .
`` My brother is waiting , '' explained Lincoln .
`` He is alone in the wind-vane offices .
They do not trust ... You know , of course -- something of your position ? ''
`` Do you mean -- ? ''
From the latter he learnt something of the state of affairs .
Abroad the downfall of the Council had been received for the most part with delight .
Nowhere was the Council popular , and the thousand cities of Western America , after two hundred years still jealous of New York , London , and the East , had risen almost unanimously two days before at the news of Graham 's imprisonment .
Paris was fighting within itself .
He tried to figure the individual life .
But now he perceived quite clearly the drone and tumult of the moving platforms and a murmur of many people .
She glanced swiftly aside to see that no other heard her words .
Presently , I suppose , I shall get into the modern way of seeing things .
I have old habits of mind clinging about me -- habits based , I suppose , on needs that are over and done with .
Only there was an ideal -- that figure of a grave , patient woman , silently and serenely mistress of a home , mother and maker of men -- to love her was a sort of worship -- ''
Graham 's mind returned to the thing at hand .
Ostrog glanced at Lincoln , who at once came towards them with his two attendants close behind him .
`` Why not ? ''
Until ten minutes since I did not know you had returned .
Its first function must clearly be that .
Before a war can break out there must be the possibility of a world decision upon its rights and wrongs .
The League , therefore , will have as its primary function to maintain a Supreme Court , whose decisions will be final , before which every sovereign power may appear as plaintiff against any other sovereign power or group of powers .
The plea , I take it , will always be in the form that the defendant power or powers is engaged in proceedings `` calculated to lead to a breach of the peace , '' and calling upon the League for an injunction against such proceedings .
I suppose the proceedings that can be brought into court in this way fall under such headings as these that follow ; restraint of trade by injurious tariffs or suchlike differentiations or by interference with through traffic , improper treatment of the subjects _or their property_ ( here I put a query ) of the plaintiff nation in the defendant state , aggressive military or naval preparation , disorder spreading over the frontier , trespass ( as , for instance , by airships ) , propaganda of disorder , espionage , permitting the organization of injurious activities , such as raids or piracy .
But in addition there is a more doubtful and delicate class of case , arising out of the discontent of patches of one race or religion in the dominions of another .
There is quite naturally a sustained opposition to it in all the fastnesses of aggressive imperialism .
One can trace week by week and almost day by day the Americanization of the British conception of the Allied War Aims .
It may be interesting to reproduce here three communications upon this question made at different times by the present writer to the press .
The circumstances of their publication are significant .
The correspondence of the _Times_ is now apparently selected and edited in accordance with the views upon public policy held by the acting editor for the day .
In such terms as these the Oceanic Allies could now state their war-will and carry the world straightway into a new phase of human history .
It is n't -- what am I going to do ?
There were wars -- little wars -- that altered nothing material ... .
You could run over all Europe , barring Turkey and Russia , without even a passport .
Dr. Martineau had thrust him back from his intenser prepossessions to a more generalized view of himself , had made his troubles objective and detached him from them .
There were entertaining possibilities in the prospect of the doctor drawing him out -- he himself partly assisting and partly resisting .
I have always realized that .
I 've done what I could to make things up to her ... .
Heaven knows what counter disappointments she has concealed ... .
`` That , '' said Sir Richmond after a brief pause , `` is a good guess . ''
`` Life did n't seem so complicated then , '' Sir Richmond mused .
`` Our muddles were unconscious .
Or did strange men bring a sickness -- measles , perhaps , or the black death ?
The two gentlemen lingered at the turnstile for a moment or so to watch his proceedings .
The long Downland gradients , quivering very slightly with the vibration of the road , came swiftly and easily to meet and pass the throbbing little car as he sat beside her and talked to her .
`` I wish you would . ''
Free to flop about .
`` I love you , '' she said , `` with all myself . ''
He was astonished to think how planless , instinctive and unforeseeing his treatment of Miss Grammont had been .
It had been just a blind drive to get hold of her and possess her ... .
`` I did n't think of your father before , and now I think of him it sets me bristling for a fight .
`` And already -- it is unreal .
He was wondering now whether after all he ought to have let her go .
If she had loved him truly and altogether could she have left him like this ?
Neither of them surely had intended so complete a separation .
Incessant and insoluble dispute .
And then the work !
`` Go in a closed car from door to door .
`` There was much happiness he might have had .
But he never seemed happy .
This work of his came before it .
He sacrificed his happiness and mine . ''
Modern religion appeals to no revelation , no authoritative teaching , no mystery .
All this is in the nature of things .
If every one who perceives and states it were to be instantly killed and blotted out , presently other people would find their way to the same conclusions ; and so on again and again .
To it indeed much religion is already coming .
There has dropped upon the table as I write a modest periodical called THE NORTHERN BRITISH ISRAEL REVIEW , illustrated with portraits of various clergymen of the Church of England , and of ladies and gentlemen who belong to the little school of thought which this magazine represents ; it is , I should judge , a sub-sect entirely within the Established Church of England , that is to say within the Anglican communion of the Trinitarian Christians .
They are distinctly hostile views .
Mr. Landseer Mackenzie discourses not only upon these anticipatory condemnations but also upon the relations of the weather to this war .
He is convinced quite simply and honestly that God has been persistently rigging the weather against the Germans .
He ignores the part played by the weather in delaying the relief of Kut-el-Amara , and he has not thought of the difficult question why the Deity , having once decided upon intervention , did not , instead of this comparatively trivial meteorological assistance , adopt the more effective course of , for example , exploding or spoiling the German stores of ammunition by some simple atomic miracle , or misdirecting their gunfire by a sudden local modification of the laws of refraction or gravitation .
I find , in one of the pages of it , the statement that between the ages of six and six and a half years would be the proper time for the inculcation of the teaching which is to be found in the book .
We come staggering through into the golden light of his kingdom , to fight for his kingdom henceforth , until at last we are altogether taken up into his being .
`` Pisgah -- the Promised Land ! ''
Incidentally our God dies a million deaths , but the thing that matters is not the deaths but the immortality .
It may be he can not escape in this person or that person being nailed to a cross or chained to be torn by vultures on a rock .
these things jar with our spirit .
We can not accept the Christian 's crucifix , or pray to a pitiful God .
Our crucifix , if you must have a crucifix , would show God with a hand or a foot already torn away from its nail , and with eyes not downcast but resolute against the sky ; a face without pain , pain lost and forgotten in the surpassing glory of the struggle and the inflexible will to live and prevail .
I do not think modern religion owes much to what is called Deism or Theism .
The rather abstract and futile Deism of the eighteenth century , of `` votre Etre supreme '' who bored the friends of Robespierre , was a sterile thing , it has little relation to these modern developments , it conceived of God as an infinite Being of no particular character whereas God is a finite being of a very especial character .
There is a curious modernity about very many of Christ 's recorded sayings .
Revived religion has also , no doubt , been the receiver of many religious bankruptcies , of Positivism for example , which failed through its bleak abstraction and an unspiritual texture .
And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling .
'Then , going up a broad staircase , we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry .
Except at one end where the roof had collapsed , this gallery was well preserved .
I went eagerly to every unbroken case .
Very eagerly I tried them .
They were perfectly good .
They were not even damp .
`` Dance , '' I cried to her in her own tongue .
And so , in that derelict museum , upon the thick soft carpeting of dust , to Weena 's huge delight , I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance , whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could .
For I am naturally inventive , as you know .
'To tell you the truth ...
I hardly believe it myself ... .
`` -- necessitates a certain retirement .
Not at present , certainly .
No sooner had Fearenside 's dog caught sight of him , however , than it began to bristle and growl savagely , and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop , and then sprang straight at his hand .
and snatched his whip .
`` It 's a rummy case altogether .
The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone .
Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down .
`` It 's strange , perhaps , but it 's not a crime .
`` Says he wi ' nart , '' said Hall .
`` War n't speaking to us , wuz he ? ''
`` I wish you would n't .
`` I ai n't seen a paper these four days , '' said Marvel .
In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand .
`` The yard door was open ! ''
The bearded man 's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down .
The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained .
`` How on earth -- ? ''
The Invisible Man was silent for a space .
When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room , Kemp was still pacing up and down , trying to grasp the incredible .
The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this .
He awoke in an evil temper , and Kemp , alert for every sound , heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead .
Then a chair was flung over and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed .
Kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly .
`` I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street , leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked .
You must set every available man to work ; you must prevent his leaving this district .
He dreams of a reign of terror !
A reign of terror , I tell you .
You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping .
The garrison must help .
You must wire for help .
It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit , not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock 's lodge gate .
Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or forty-six , steward to Lord Burdock , of inoffensive habits and appearance , the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist .
These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another .
We may understand something of his exasperation , and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him .
Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street , rushed by a greengrocer 's cart , hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop , and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again .
Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts .
Out he shot into Hill Street again , three hundred yards from the tram-line end , and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people .
`` Do n't mention it , '' said Platt .
He was an obstinate player of draughts and chess , and an earnest and persistent reader of the _British Weekly_ .
She had large blue expressive eyes and a round face , and she always spoke of her husband as Harold .
She addressed sympathetic and considerate remarks about the deceased to Mr. Polly in notes of brisk encouragement .
`` He was really quite cheerful at the end , '' she said several times , with congratulatory gusto , `` quite cheerful . ''
`` But -- -- ! ''
The grey dress made her a stranger to him , made her stiff and commonplace , she was not even the rather drooping form that had caught his facile sense of beauty when he had proposed to her in the Recreation Ground .
Then came Miriam 's turn .
`` _Verbum_ sap , '' said Mr. Polly , and abandoned the horse and turned , to the door .
It opened to him just as Mrs. Larkins on the arm of Johnson , followed by Annie , Minnie , two friends , Mrs. Punt and her son and at a slight distance Uncle Pentstemon , appeared round the corner .
It needed a particularly dry and dusty east wind , a Sunday dinner of exceptional virulence , a conclusive letter from Konk , Maybrick , Ghool and Gabbitas , his principal and most urgent creditors , and a conversation with Miriam arising out of arrears of rent and leading on to mutual character sketching , before Mr. Polly could be brought to the necessary pitch of despair to carry out his plans .
He went for an embittering walk , and came back to find Miriam in a bad temper over the tea things , with the brewings of three-quarters of an hour in the pot , and hot buttered muffin gone leathery .
He sat eating in silence with his resolution made .
`` I do n't mind scrambling , '' she said with piping inflexibility , `` but I ca n't jump and I _wunt_ jump . ''
`` So long as you have n't the habit , '' said the plump woman .
'Like a bad shillin ' -- like a damned bad shilling .
I 'm a Reformatory Reformed Character , warranted all right and turned out as such .
By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with many quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones , but it is only as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as `` almost human . ''
These traces are not bones but implements .
But at Trinil in Java , in accumulations of this age , a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man , with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes , which seems to have walked erect .
This creature is now called _Pithecanthropus erectus_ , the walking ape man , and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to , ourselves the makers of the Eoliths .
In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C.
The potato , which was the principal food stuff in Peru , was unknown in Mexico .
Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Rameses and Necho had done before him .
At Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh , { 148 } which was already a forgotten city , he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the war .
Darius led the retreat .
He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled northward into the country of the Medes .
Alexander marched on to Babylon , still prosperous and important , and then to Susa and Persepolis .
There were poor free-men { 205 } and there were freed-men in the cities and upon the country side , working for themselves or even working for wages .
And there were also many modifications of slavery , from the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry , to the slave whose master found it advantageous to leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife like a free-man , provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his owner .
The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common people in European history .
Before very long we shall find it stirring again , and raising the most disturbing social and religious questions .
[ Illustration : A COURTYARD IN THE ALHAMBRA ]
He and his successors were pitted against an even more interesting personality , the Emperor Frederick II ; _Stupor mundi_ he was called , the Wonder of the world .
The struggle of this monarch against Rome is a turning place in history .
It is scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe possible .
Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist .
But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly .
The English , the Danes and Swedes , and presently the Dutch , were soon staking { 330 } out claims in North America and the West Indies , and his Most Catholic Majesty of France heeded the papal settlement as little as any Protestant .
But for Lincoln there was no doubt .
Into this new world came the Europeans , and found the rifle already there in the hands of the Arab slave-traders , and negro life in disorder .
The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them , turned suddenly , listened for a moment , lifted his eyebrows at the older man , and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony .
He cursed suddenly under his breath , and turned his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly expression .
It was a surge of many voices , rising and falling , shouting and screaming , and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries , and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks .
he said to the tailor .
His manner was calm , but his eyes were full of curiosity .
`` You must come away ! ''
His face and eyes were resolute , too .
Graham 's glances went from face to face , and he was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life , compulsion .
For a space he sobbed for breath , and then he sat still with his face covered .
The air was full of the shouting of innumerable men .
He saw anxiety and fear in their faces .
He too looked up .
Graham 's eyes fell to the ways again .
He saw it was a dense mass of red-clad men jammed on the higher further way , their backs against the pitiless cliff of building , and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists .
For a time he heard the old man 's hobbling pursuit and his wheezy cries receding .
The Surveyor-General seemed quietly amused at the Master 's fundamental bluntness .
I suppose they are the men who control the great public businesses .
`` But what did you think I meant ? ''
The girl 's attitude awaited dismissal .
As it lay on its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage , its aluminum body skeleton was as big as the hull of a twenty-ton yacht .
The chairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle , within the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle .
It could , if desired , be completely closed in , but Graham was anxious for novel experiences , and desired that it should be left open .
The passenger could secure himself firmly in his seat , and this was almost unavoidable on landing , or he could move along by means of a little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine , where his personal luggage , his wraps and restoratives were placed , and which also with the seats , served as a makeweight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the propeller at the stern .
She spoke with an effort .
`` You forget , '' she said , drawing a deep breath .
She started and for an instant her eyes had pity .
`` Need you ask whether I will help you ? ''
These parasitic lunatics -- ''
Many of the shouts were unintelligible .
`` Ostrog has betrayed us , '' one man bawled in a hoarse voice , again and again , dinning that refrain into Graham 's ear until it haunted him .
His cry about Ostrog alternated with some incomprehensible orders .
Presently he went leaping down and disappeared .
He glanced at Lincoln again .
Graham perceived that he was no longer encompassed by people , that he was standing upon a little temporary platform of white metal , part of a flimsy seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of the Council House .
Up the steep stairs of wall and scaffolding by which his rescuers had reached the opening in the Atlas Chamber clung a solid crowd , and little energetic black figures clinging to pillars and projections were strenuous to induce these congested , masses to stir .
Through the yawning gap in the walls below him he could look down upon the packed attentive multitudes in the Hall of the Atlas .
The distant flying stages to the south came out bright and vivid , brought nearer as it seemed by an unusual translucency of the air .
The man in yellow hesitated .
A few yards behind them lay a dead stranger , face upward to the sky , with the blue canvas of his jacket smouldering in a circle about the neat bullet hole on his chest .
He fancied himself free of all excitement , felt cool and deliberate .
He lifted the stem still more , opened one valve on his left wing and swept round and up .
He looked down with a steady head , and up .
Its little aeronauts were peering down at him .
One , he saw held a weapon pointing , seemed prepared to fire .
His momentary lethargy was past .
He opened two more valves to his left , swung round , end on to this hostile machine , closed his valves , and shot straight at it , stem and wind-screen shielding him from the shot .
They tilted a little as if to clear him .
He became aware of three others rushing towards him , aware of the urgent necessity of beating above them .
They drove past him , above , below , eastward and westward .
Far away to the westward was the sound of a collision , and two falling flares .
Steadily he beat upward .
Presently all the aeroplanes were below him , but for a moment he doubted the height he had of them , and did not swoop again .
The great fabric seemed to be standing on end for a second among the heeling and splintering vans , and then it flew to pieces .
Huge splinters came flying through the air , its engines burst like shells .
`` I wo n't keep you very long , daddy , '' said Ann Veronica .
`` There 's the whole situation .
Apparently I 'm not to exist yet .
I 'm not to study , I 'm not to grow .
The relationship seemed to have almost as much to do with blood and body as a mortgage .
It was something that would create a mutual claim , a relationship .
It was in another world from that in which men will die for a kiss , and touching hands lights fires that burn up lives -- the world of romance , the world of passionately beautiful things .
She inhaled a deep breath of air -- London air .
That was the quintessence of her brother Roddy .
`` The dawn ! ''
She pursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the Suffragist agitation in the company of Miss Miniver .
They went to various central and local Fabian gatherings , and to a number of suffrage meetings .
Teas he contributed to the commissariat of Ann Veronica 's campaign -- quite a number of teas .
At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition of Meredith's novels , very prettily bound in flexible leather , being guided in the choice of an author , as he intimated , rather by her preferences than his own .
She looked down at him and saw that the sunlight was gleaming from his cheeks , and that all over his cheeks was a fine golden down of delicate hairs .
Will you please -- Not now , or I must go . ''
`` I 'll frame it -- when I get it . ''
Capes joined the students at tea , and displayed himself in an impish mood that sometimes possessed him .
Miss Klegg raised the question of women 's suffrage , and he set himself to provoke a duel between her and Miss Garvice .
Which is C ? ''
was one of the night 's inspirations , and very frequent .
Immeasurable disgust possessed her .
She lay still for a long time , and her mind resumed at a more tolerable pace .
Manning was silent for a space .
`` As my lady wills . ''
`` I do n't think it makes a rap of difference , except for one thing .
He said nothing for a space .
Her heart leaped within her as she caught that phrase .
She felt very restless and excited .
This -- this is degradation -- making a fuss with sleeves .
`` Not a bit . ''
We regarded each other for a moment .
I raised my hat and wished him a good evening .
I did n't , of course , foresee this little upset .
My mind was preoccupied with another problem , and I 'm apt to disregard these practical side issues .
But it 's all right -- ''
`` But what do you expect ?
I will open a blind -- ''
I caught a second glimpse of things without , puffs of vapour , half liquid slush , excavated , sliding , falling , sliding .
We dropped into darkness .
I went down with Cavor 's knees in my chest .
I saw the bubbles dancing on the glass above .
Thereupon he made me desist .
It speedily became evident that the pressure outside was very much less than it was within .
How much less it was we had no means of telling .
So we two poor terrestrial castaways , lost in that wild-growing moon jungle , crawled in terror before the sounds that had come upon us .
We crawled , as it seemed , a long time before we saw either Selenite or mooncalf , though we heard the bellowing and gruntulous noises of these latter continually drawing nearer to us .
We crawled through stony ravines , over snow slopes , amidst fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our thrust , emitting a watery humour , over a perfect pavement of things like puff-balls , and beneath interminable thickets of scrub .
And ever more helplessly our eyes sought for our abandoned sphere .
The noise of the mooncalves would at times be a vast flat calf-like sound , at times it rose to an amazed and wrathy bellowing , and again it would become a clogged bestial sound , as though these unseen creatures had sought to eat and bellow at the same time .
Our first view was but an inadequate transitory glimpse , yet none the less disturbing because it was incomplete .
He stopped dead , arresting me with a single gesture .
We could distinguish nothing that would give us a clue to the meaning of the faint shapes we saw .
`` My head ! ''
I heard him say ; `` my head ! ''
`` You see , '' said Cavor , `` these may be Selenites of a lower class . ''
By way of answer he pricked me forthwith .
`` You 've spoilt it all ! ''
`` Nonsense , '' I cried .
`` Never wanted that either . ''
If suddenly we appeared here -- ''
`` Keep close , '' I said .
`` Yes -- the lights of the world that now we shall never see . ''
He shook his head , and stared away from me across the waste .
A sense of how we had galled each other , and particularly how I must have galled him , came to me .
The nearer I struggled , the more awfully remote it seemed .
It seemed to me that my body must be suddenly changed to lead .
And he goes on from that point to say that `` We came to a difficult passage with them , and Bedford mistaking certain gestures of theirs '' -- pretty gestures they were !
-- '' gave way to a panic violence .
We made our way to the exterior and separated in the crater of our arrival , to increase our chances of recovering our sphere .
This they did , and , perceiving my helpless condition , carried me with them again into the moon .
And of Bedford I have heard or seen nothing more , nor , so far as I can gather , any Selenite .
These shafts communicate by transverse tunnels , they throw out abysmal caverns and expand into great globular places ; the whole of the moon 's substance for a hundred miles inward , indeed , is a mere sponge of rock .
Suddenly and violently there was forced upon my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst these beings of the moon .
Cavor seems to have sent most of it without interference , but to have been interrupted in the concluding portion .
The second came after an interval of a week .
And if it should chance that the reader finds this ring untrue to him , then he may take it that he stands outside us , that the New Republic is not for him .
He has a very simple ideal , to which he directs the entire pairing of his stock .
He breeds for beef , he breeds for calves and milk , he breeds for a homogeneous docile herd .
Which is just what our theoretical breeders of humanity can not venture to do .
They do not want a homogeneous race in the future at all .
Now what the elements of personal aspect really are , what these elements a , b , c , d , e , f , etc.
, may be , we do not know with any sort of exactness .
But we are not even sure of that .
Practically the Crown has now gone unchallenged by press , pulpit , or platform speaker for thirty years , and as a natural consequence there is just now a smaller proportion of men under forty who call themselves Republicans even in private than there ever was since Plutarch entered the circle of English reading .
For example , the theory that every man is as good as his neighbour , and possibly a little better , has no check for fools , and instead of the respectful silences of England there seems -- to the ordinary English mind -- an extraordinary quantity of crude and unsound judgments in America .
The real and steady development of American scientific men is masked to the European observer , and it must be greatly hampered by the copious silliness of the amateur discoverer , and the American crop of new religions and new enthusiasms is a horror and a warning to the common British intelligence .
If ninety-nine people out of the hundred in our race are vulgar and unwise , it does seem to be a fact that while the English fool is generally a shy and negative fool anxious to hide the fact , the American fool is a loud and positive fool , who swamps much of the greatness of his country to many a casual observer from Europe altogether .
In Great Britain public pomposities take up the strain and deliver large vague , foolish discourses on our intellectual decline .
An inspection of a Public Library Catalogue reveals , no doubt , a certain proportion of `` serious '' books available , but , as a rule , that `` serious side '' is a quite higgledy-piggledy heap of fragments .
Suppose , for example , an intelligent mechanic has a proclivity for economic questions , he will find no book whatever to guide him to what literature there may be upon those questions .
He will plunge into the catalogue , and discover perhaps a few publications of the Cobden Club , Henry George 's _Progress and Poverty_ , J. S. Mill's _Autobiography_ , Ruskin 's _Unto This Last , The Statesman 's Year Book for 1895_ , and a text-book specially adapted to such and such an examination by the tutors of some Correspondence College .
What is the most intelligent of mechanics likely to secure for himself from this bran pie ?
Serious subjects are not to be read in this wild disorderly way .
He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this , but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder .
There was a noise of business from the gasworks , and the electric lamps were all alight .
In the centre , sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart , was this cylinder .
But the poison was scarcely working yet .
Around it was a patch of silent common , smouldering in places , and with a few dark , dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there .
The fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery , deaden nerve and destroy brain , had still to develop .
It was a day of lassitude too , hot and close , with , I am told , a rapidly fluctuating barometer .
I went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening , but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark .
`` Blow yer trenches !
Trying to rejoin battery , sir .
You 'll come in sight of the Martians , I expect , about half a mile along this road . ''
For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do .
There was no fresh news of the invaders from Mars .
Over Ealing , Richmond , Wimbledon , it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart .
They were all stalking seaward , as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze .
In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat , and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her , she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance .
Sheen , it seemed , had escaped destruction , but the place was silent and deserted .
Here we happened on no dead , though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place .
In Sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst , and we decided to try one of the houses .
I am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening .
I told the curate I was going to seek food , and felt my way towards the pantry .
In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread .
A cankering disease , due , it is believed , to the action of certain bacteria , presently seized upon it .
`` Great God ! ''
And suddenly I gripped his hand .
I could not bring myself to go on .
I hid from the night and the silence , until long after midnight , in a cabmen 's shelter in Harrow Road .
I missed my way among the streets , and presently saw down a long avenue , in the half-light of the early dawn , the curve of Primrose Hill .

But the allantois and yolk sac of the rabbit , though they correspond in development , differ entirely in function from the similar organs of the fowl .
The yolk sac is of the very smallest nutritive value ; instead of being the sole source of food , its contents scarcely avail the young rabbit at all as nourishment .
At an early stage , the outgrowing allantois , pushing in front of it the serous membrane , is closely applied to the lining of the mother 's uterus .
Through its intermediation , the young rabbit becomes , as it were , rooted and parasitic on the mother , and utilizes her organs for its own alimentation , respiration , and excretion .
This is the better method that has superseded the yolk .

She became teeming anticipations .
Daffy was not copper red like her sister , but really quite coarsely red-haired ; she was bigger than Marjorie , and with irregular teeth instead of Marjorie 's neat row ; she confessed them in a broad simple smile of welcome .

He spent long intervals sitting on his window-sill regarding a world that was scented with nightstock , and seemed to be woven of moonshine and gossamer .
It would be easy for them to get away ; he had no lectures until February ; he could , he said , make arrangements , leave his research .
`` A town or something -- never mind .
Look at the colour .
It heartens everything . ''
This new play has taken it out of Will tremendously .
He wants a rest and fresh surroundings .
It 's to be the biggest piece of work he 's done -- so far , and it's straining him .
And people worry him here ; receptions , first nights , dinners , speeches .
But it wastes him .
Outside in the corridor there broke out a noisy dispute about a missing coupon , a dispute in that wonderful language that is known to the facetious as _entente cordiale_ , between an Englishman and the conductor of the train ... .
He thought in silence for a time , oddly regardless of her .
Thank God , our children are love children !
then I think now -- I 'd be glad -- I 'd be glad , I think , to cheat life of her victory . ''
There is such a thing as a personal side to Eugenics , you know . ''
Dowd became busy with his work .
`` And what would that do ? ''
No Blenkins believes that sort of thing , but of course , if Trafford chose to keep his own counsel -- --
`` Good luck ! ''
What was that reality ?
So did that little beast until I got him . ''
She nodded at the skin in his hand .
Even if it is n't too late to fish .
We may have to last right into July .
`` We have intimations .
Neither of us really understands .
`` That was a good place .
I remember there was stewed beef once with a lot of barley -- such _good_ barley ! ''
But he does not put on side . ''
It was the first detached and adverse criticism of the Englishman I had ever encountered .
The war endorsed its every word for me , underlined each warning indication of the gigantic dangers that gathered against our system across the narrow seas .
It discovered Europe to me , as watching and critical .
I know if I do n't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk .
I feel like a loaded gun that is only a little perplexed because it has to find out just where to aim itself ... . ''
I heard talk of strikes and rumours of strikes , and learnt from the columns of some obscure labour paper I bought one day , of the horrors of the lead poisoning that was in those days one of the normal risks of certain sorts of pottery workers .
I found great virtue in the word `` exploitation . ''
I had remembered him as a big and buoyant man , striding destructively about the nursery floor of my childhood , and saluting my existence by slaps , loud laughter , and questions about half herrings and half eggs subtly framed to puzzle and confuse my mind .
I did n't see him for some years until my father 's death , and then he seemed rather smaller , though still a fair size , yellow instead of red and much less radiantly aggressive .
I still remember very distinctly my uncle 's talk , -- he loved to speak `` reet Staffordshire '' -- his rather flabby face with the mottled complexion that told of crude ill-regulated appetites , his clumsy gestures -- he kept emphasising his points by prodding at me with his finger -- the ill-worn , costly , grey tweed clothes , the watch chain of plain solid gold , and soft felt hat thrust back from his head .
`` But what 's the good of talking ? ''
He hated all education after fifteen because he had had no education after fifteen , he hated all people who did not have high tea until he himself under duress gave up high tea , he hated every game except football , which he had played and could judge , he hated all people who spoke foreign languages because he knew no language but Staffordshire , he hated all foreigners because he was English , and all foreign ways because they were not his ways .
Also he hated particularly , and in this order , Londoner 's , Yorkshiremen , Scotch , Welch and Irish , because they were not `` reet Staffordshire , '' and he hated all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently `` reet . ''
He wanted to have all his own women inviolate , and to fancy he had a call upon every other woman in the world .
He wanted to have the best cigars and the best brandy in the world to consume or give away magnificently , and every one else to have inferior ones .
Our marriage had done this much at least , that it had fused and destroyed those two independent ways of thinking about her that had gone on in my mind hitherto .
The judgments and understandings that had worked when she was , so to speak , miles away from my life , had now to be altogether revised .
Trifling things began to matter enormously , that she had a weak and easily fatigued back , for example , or that when she knitted her brows and stammered a little in talking , it did n't really mean that an exquisite significance struggled for utterance .
I was going to `` take hold '' at last , the Kinghamstead Division was my appointed handle .
I was to find my place in the rather indistinctly sketched constructions that were implicit in the minds of all our circle .
`` But that 's not a programme , '' said the doctor .
The Mayor of Kinghamstead , a managing little man with no great belief in my oratorical powers , was sticking his face up to mine .
`` What do they want ? ''
`` What 's it about ? ''
This main strand is the story of my obvious life , my life as it must have looked to most of my acquaintances .
Margaret wore hundreds of beautiful dresses .
We must have had an air of succeeding meritoriously during that time .
That career had its own hidden side , of course ; but when I write of these unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether broader .
Of course I do not mean by aristocracy the changing unorganised medley of rich people and privileged people who dominate the civilised world of to-day , but as opposed to this , a possibility of co-ordinating the will of the finer individuals , by habit and literature , into a broad common aim .
We must have an aristocracy -- not of privilege , but of understanding and purpose -- or mankind will fail .
I find this dawning more and more clearly when I look through my various writings of the years between 1903 and 1910 .
I was already emerging to plain statements in 1908 .
We parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow -- but in that sort of glow one does n't act upon without much reconsideration , and it was some months before I made my decision to follow up the indications of that opening talk .
cried Margaret , stung ; and I could see she thought I was talking mere wickedness .
`` But would you have people drink whatever they pleased ? ''
`` Against us ! ''
As if it did n't call upon every able man ! ''
The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage cab .
I think there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving realisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one .
It slinks from you , turns aside its face .
Yet we went on working , visiting , meeting , trying to ignore this gathering of implacable forces against us .
I was staring at her face .
It seemed white and set in the dimness .
`` You and I , Isabel , '' I said , `` have always been a little disregardful of duty , partly at least because the idea of duty comes to us so ill-clad .
I wish all duty was n't covered with slime .
But for all its mean associations there is this duty ... .
I took her ticket , saw to her luggage , and stood by the door of the compartment .
She bent above me , white and dusky , looking at me very steadfastly .
Suitable for p'litical dec'rations .
Postcard , Christmas , gilt lets , in a wreath of white flow 's .
We had , thank Heaven !
The jungle was full of moonlight ; twigs , branches , creepers , grass-clumps came out acutely vivid .
Things seemed to be clear and yet uncertain .
It was as if they dissolved or retired a little and then returned to solidity .
`` How do you like Cambridge ?
-- and delivered your maiden speech ?
If you're for politics , Poff , that 's your game .
Have you begun it ? ''
`` But -- Mother , this is rather astounding ... .
It made Prothero none the less indignant with this , that there was indeed a grain of truth in it .
`` I do not care if this instant I am stricken dead for pride .
It did not contain his sins .
And there were several sheets of the Ordnance map .
This was the idea of working out for himself , thoroughly and completely , a political scheme , a theory of his work and duty in the world , a plan of the world 's future that should give a rule for his life .
The Research Magnificent was emerging .
`` Well , '' she said , `` well .
-- whatever she calls herself , must look after herself .
It 's been a tiresome season .
They 've asked us twice ... . ''
So Benham was able to convert the unfortunate Mrs. Skelmersdale into a tender but for a long time an entirely painful memory .
Nolan was inexplicable ; he was , Benham understood quite clearly , never to be mentioned again ; but somehow from the past his shadow and his legacy cast a peculiar and perplexing shadow of undefined obligation upon Benham 's outlook .
This sub-Amanda was perceptible next morning again , flitting about in the background of a glad and loving adventuress , a pre-occupied Amanda who had put her head down while the real Amanda flung her chin up and contemplated things on the Asiatic scale , and who was apparently engaged in disentangling something obscure connected with Mr. Rathbone-Sanders that ought never to have been entangled ... .
Benham 's earnest face was within a yard of his own , and a threatening forefinger was almost touching his nose .
And it is not usual in Albania generally for women , whether they are Christian or Moslem , to go about unveiled ; when they do so it leads to singular manifestations .
Sketching is always a peltable or mobable offence , as being contrary to the Koran , and sitting down tempts the pelter .
In Albania there is sometimes very heavy rain .
`` Yes , '' he said , `` I want to have children , but I must go round the world none the less . ''
`` The trouble has gone too far .
I do n't like them any more .
He surveyed his friend's thoughtful attitude .
I 'm beginning now to understand the bitterness of spinsters against men .
It was the substance of their talk as the Holland boat stood out past waiting destroyers and winking beacons and the lights of Harwich , into the smoothly undulating darkness of the North Sea ; it rose upon them again as they sat over the cakes and cheese of a Dutch breakfast in the express for Berlin .
Prothero filled the Sieges Allee with his complaints against nature and society , and distracted Benham in his contemplation of Polish agriculture from the windows of the train with turgid sexual liberalism .
So that Benham , during this period until Prothero left him and until the tragic enormous spectacle of Russia in revolution took complete possession of him , was as it were thinking upon two floors .
Upon the one he was thinking of the vast problems of a society of a hundred million people staggering on the verge of anarchy , and upon the other he was perplexed by the feverish inattention of Prothero to the tremendous things that were going on all about them .
Billy , my dear -- I 'm not your father , I 'm not your judge .
If you want to stay in Moscow , stay in Moscow .
`` She misses you terribly , '' said Sir Philip ; `` it is a time when a woman misses her husband .
Now I saw her plainly , I saw her with that same dreadful clearness that sometimes comes at dawn , a pitiless , a scientific distinctness that has neither light nor shadow ... .
`` There are no such women . ''
He had written this in and struck it out , and then at some later time written it in again .
And , indeed , there was another sheet of pencilled broken stuff that seemed to glance at quite another type of womanhood .
The bulk of his work was to discover and define that purpose , that purpose which must be the directing and comprehending form of all the activities of the noble life .
It will trample cities ; it will devour nations ... . ''
`` I will tell you what I believe . ''
( As he talked his voice was for a space drowned by the jingle and voices of mounted police riding past the hotel . )
I said , `` How would you like your soldiers to come alive , Gip , and march about by themselves ? ''
He turned in his saddle for a time , and stared at the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come .
He dropped again into his former pose .
`` A coward possibly .
That I have learnt at last .
At that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger .
And as he did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him .
He looked at the cobwebs ; he looked at the smoke .
But after going so far Pyecraft was resolved I should go farther .
`` Why do n't you do them now ? ''
said Sanderson , shutting his pen-knife with a click .
I 'd have thought it a big octopus , or some such thing , if it had n't been for the boot .
I felt myself sinking down again , and I threw my arms about to keep steady , and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as I went up -- ''
`` Kneel , '' said the stout gentleman , `` and hold up your hands . ''
With the assistance of several passers-by -- for the whole street was speedily alive with running people -- Mr. Vincey struggled to his feet .
He had suddenly appeared in the middle of the market screaming `` LIFE !
striking left and right with a blood-stained walking-stick , and dancing and shouting with laughter at each successful blow .
A lad and two women had broken heads , and he had smashed a man 's wrist ; a little child had been knocked insensible , and for a time he had driven every one before him , so furious and resolute had his behaviour been .
said I ; `` did he -- ? ''
They had some glorious times , and Fanny could not think what they would have done without him .
They never flagged -- through pictures and sculpture galleries , immense crowded churches , ruins and museums , Judas trees and prickly pears , wine carts and palaces , they admired their way unflinchingly .
`` Here Caesar may have walked , '' they would say .
`` Raphael may have seen Soracte from this very point . ''
`` The oldest monument of Republican Rome ! ''
`` I 'm dreadfully stupid , '' said Fanny , `` but who WAS Bibulus ? ''
`` Was n't he the person who built the wall ? ''
`` But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things .
It 's emotion , it 's a tint , a light that comes and goes .
Only while it's there , everything changes , everything .
The thing is I came away and left them in their Crisis to do what they could . ''
`` The vision was so real , you must understand , so utterly unlike a dream that I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details ; even the ornament of a book-cover that lay on my wife 's sewing-machine in the breakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger from my deserted party .
They were great driving things shaped like spearheads without a shaft , with a propeller in the place of the shaft . ''
We talked , and she clung to me , torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet .
I had silenced all the voices , I had answered all the questions -- I had come to her .
And suddenly there was nothing but War and Death ! ''
`` At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity , but when I had seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them .
He describes very pleasantly the journey through the hills and open land of Brabant , the repeated crossing of arms of the Rhine , and the change from the undulating scenery of Belgium to the flat , rich meadows , the sunlit dyke roads , and the countless windmills of the Dutch levels .
In those days there was unbroken land from Alkmaar and Leiden to the Dollart .
The fires burnt the brighter , and some Irishmen away across the meer started singing .
But Barnet 's men were too weary for that sort of thing , and soon the bank and the barge were heaped with sleeping forms .
They sprinkled the nations -- with Kingship . '
Their passengers descended , and ran , holding their light rifles in their hands towards the debris and the two dead men .
And as he spoke they saw the ex-king stretch out his arms slowly , like one who yawns , knuckle his eyes and turn inward -- no doubt to his bed .
Essentially it was to place social organisation upon the new footing that the swift , accelerated advance of human knowledge had rendered necessary .
The council was gathered together with the haste of a salvage expedition , and it was confronted with wreckage ; but the wreckage was irreparable wreckage , and the only possibilities of the case were either the relapse of mankind to the agricultural barbarism from which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the basis of a new social order .
It was for the latter alternative that the assembly existed .
There is too much facile misrepresentation , too ready a disposition on either side to accept caricatures as portraits and charges as facts .
Between the busy and preoccupied owning and employing class on the one hand , and the distressed , uneasy masses on the other , intervenes the professional politician , not as a mediator , but as an obstacle , who must be propitiated before any dealings are possible .
On the whole , they are prepared for the gradual disentanglement of men from the Normal Social Life altogether , and they look for new ways of living and new methods of human association with a certain adventurous hopefulness .
We have n't these officers , and we ca n't make them in a hurry .
It is indeed an ideal problem for a healthy , hopeful , and progressive middle-aged public man .
A great number of people object to divorce under any circumstances whatever .
Re-marriage is regarded by such people as a posthumous bigamy .
There is certainly a very strong and logical case to be made out for a marriage bond that is indissoluble even by death .
The family would be the social unit and the father its public representative , and though the law might intervene if he murdered or ill-used wife or children , or they him , it would do so in just the same spirit that it might prevent him from self-mutilation or attempted suicide , for the good of the State simply , and not to defend any supposed independence of the injured member .
There is much , I assert , to be said for such a complete shutting up of the family from the interference of the law , and not the least among these reasons is the entire harmony of such a view with the passionate instincts of the natural man and woman in these matters .
The economic process of the last half-century , so far as America is concerned has completely justified the generalisations of Marx .
The tradition of individual freedom and equality is , in fact , in process of destroying the realities of freedom and equality out of which it rose .
In the last few decades slums as frightful as any in Europe have appeared with terrible rapidity , and there has been a development of the viler side of industrialism , of sweating and base employment of the most ominous kind .
Just as far as these reform efforts succeed and develop is the organisation of the United States of America into a great , self-conscious , civilised nation , unparalleled in the world 's history , possible ; just as far as they fail is failure written over the American future .
You can transfer your apprenticeship , and -- er -- well , I 'm not the sort of man to be careless with trust funds , you can be sure .
-- quite a decent little sum . ''
He greeted me warmly .
He struck me as being rather shabby , and the silk hat he produced and put on , when , after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me , was past its first youth ; but he was as buoyant and confident as ever .
`` How 's Life 's Morning , Ponderevo ?
`` We 're young -- yes .
But one must inquire .
Feels that on the whole it amounts to a call ... .
But the bother is I do n't see where I come in at all .
And I 'm a student myself at the Consolidated Technical Schools . ''
His telegram had been handed in at Farringdon Road , and after complex meditations I replied to Ponderevo , Farringdon Road , trusting to the rarity of our surname to reach him .
do n't see where your swindle comes in . ''
Pecunnia non olet , -- a Roman emperor said that .
Running through all my thoughts , surging out like a refrain , was my uncle 's master-stroke , his admirable touch of praise : `` Make it all slick -- and then make it go Woosh .
I KNOW you can ! ''
`` Marion , '' I said , `` this is n't a trifling matter to me .
I love you ; I would die to get you ... .
`` If I did n't -- If I did n't like you very much , should I let you come and meet me -- go about with you ? ''
`` I shall like to be engaged to you . ''
`` What do you think of the business ? ''
And I did n't .
I can not tell to the full how Marion thwarted me and failed in that life of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love .
A beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost infinitesimally small .
I find myself setting down little things and little things ; none of them do more than demonstrate those essential temperamental discords I have already sought to make clear .
She pursued some limited , clearly seen and experienced ideal -- that excluded all other possibilities .
Over every mantel was a mirror that was draped , our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass , we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grog-tubs .
Smithie approved it all .
And we had a piano though Marion 's playing was at an elementary level .
`` We ca n't talk here , '' I whispered with a confident intimacy .
`` Where do you go at five ? ''
Of that there is now no telling .
The cab came to the little iron gate .
I do not know where she is or what she is doing .
I do not know whether she is alive or dead .
You know -- black-lead -- for grates !
OR DOES HE PASS IT OVER AS A MATTER OF COURSE ? ''
`` They had n't much idea of ventilation when this was built . ''
My uncle offered them cigars , but they both declined , -- out of bashfulness , it seemed to me , whereas the vicar , I think , accepted out of tact .
`` I 've fancied at times ; '' I admitted .
She turned upon me abruptly when she thought her step-mother was beyond ear-shot .
She became emphatically pink .
All my later work in aeronautics is associated in my memory with the quality of Beatrice , with her incidental presence , with things she said and did and things I thought of that had reference to her .
She made no answer .
She walked across the room to the piano and began to play , rather noisily and rapidly , with odd gusts of emphasis , the shepherd 's pipe music from the last act in `` Tristan and Isolde . ''
There 's not a word of truth in the things they say about us .
I 've been slack .
I 've left things .
Even now we have a coup -- an expedition -- in hand .
`` I dessay you 'd have shoved it , George .
`` Let 's give him his commission .
He was sincerely glad to see me .
`` Can you carry this bundle ? ''
`` My God ! ''
Those -- things do n't help ! ''
Ilion House , the residence of one of our great merchant princes ... .
I could n't be any sort of helper to you , any sort of wife , any sort of mother .
They passed out of sight and left me by the roadside ... .
The whole effect is English .
There is space , there are old trees and all the best qualities of the home-land in that upper reach .
What a long slow crescendo that is , mile after mile , with the houses crowding closelier , the multiplying succession of church towers , the architectural moments , the successive bridges , until you come out into the second movement of the piece with Lambeth 's old palace under your quarter and the houses of Parliament on your bow !
Westminster Bridge is ahead of you then , and through it you flash , and in a moment the round-faced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and New Scotland Yard squares at you , a fat beef-eater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a Bastille .
This class will become , I believe , at last consciously _the_ State , controlling and restricting very greatly the three non-functional masses with which it is as yet almost indistinguishably mingled .
The general nature of its formation within the existing confusion and its emergence may , I think , with a certain degree of confidence , be already forecast , albeit at present its beginnings are singularly unpromising and faint .
And the still newer forces that have united and separated the nineteenth century states have been , and in many cases are still , in manifest conflict with `` national '' ideas .
It is not a process peculiar to any one nation .
Malthus is one of those cardinal figures in intellectual history who state definitely for all time , things apparent enough after their formulation , but never effectively conceded before .
And , having made his statement , Malthus left it , in contact with its immediate results .
At that he rushed his machine into the road , and began a hasty ascent .
Confound it , will he NEVER be able to get up on the thing again ?
He would overtake her .
Lucky he had a card case !
He set his teeth .
`` Monkey on a gridiron ! ''
Hoopdriver redoubled his efforts .
The road really was uphill beyond dispute .
`` Oh Lord ! ''
said Hoopdriver , relaxing .
Because I 've reservoirs and reservoirs of muscular energy , and one or other of them is always leaking .
It's a most interesting road , birds and trees , I 've no doubt , and wayside flowers , and there 's nothing I should enjoy more than watching them .
Get me on anything , and I have to go .
`` My dear sir , '' said the other man in brown , `` I beg your pardon .
If so , he was in for an explanation .
`` What are we to do now ? ''
`` Because it IS stealing it , you know , come to think of it . ''
Heaven send , his breath , which was already getting a trifle spasmodic , did not suddenly give out .
`` I was thinking it this morning , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver .
We have reached to a conception of that universe of molecular physics by a great enterprise of organised analysis , and our universe of daily experiences stands in relation to that elemental world as if it were a synthesis of those elemental things .
In the biological sciences of the eighteenth century , common-sense struggled hard to ignore individuality in shells and plants and animals .
There was an attempt to eliminate the more conspicuous departures as abnormalities , as sports , nature 's weak moments ; and it was only with the establishment of Darwin 's great generalizations that the hard and fast classificatory system broke down and individuality came to its own .
Yet there had always been a clearly felt difference between the conclusions of the biological sciences and those dealing with lifeless substance , in the relative vagueness , the insubordinate looseness and inaccuracy of the former .
It was , and is by the great majority of people to this day , supposed to be the latter that are invincibly true ; and the former are regarded as a more complex set of problems merely , with obliquities and refractions that presently will be explained away .
The first I call the exterior world , and it presents itself to me as existing in Time and Space .
I hope I shall offend no susceptibilities when I assert that this great and very definite personality in the hearts and imaginations of mankind does not and never has attracted me .
I do not find myself able to associate Him in any way with the emotion of Salvation .
But perhaps the Church will not endure a broad-minded man in its body , speaking and reforming , and will expel him ?
In itself abstinence seems to me a refusal to experience , and that , upon the lines of thought I follow , is to say that abstinence for its own sake is evil .
But for an end all abstinences are permissible , and if the kinetic type of believer finds both his individual and his associated efficiency enhanced by a systematic discipline , if he is convinced that he must specialize because of the discursiveness of his motives , because there is something he wants to do or be so good that the rest of them may very well be suppressed for its sake , then he must suppress .
The moderate drinker who sits at table sipping his wine in the sight of one he knows to be a potential dipsomaniac is at best an unloving fool .
Now so far as that goes it follows almost necessarily from my views upon aristocracy and democracy that I declare for the conventional equality of women , that is to say for the determination to make neither sex nor any sexual characteristic a standard of superiority or inferiority , for the view that a woman is a person as important and necessary , as much to be consulted , and entitled to as much freedom of action as a man .
To that they would lead us , though we come to it shivering , fearful and unprepared , and they grudge it that we should strip and plunge into the wayside stream .
But an expedition starves that comes to no port .
Love always seeks mutuality and grows by the sense of responses , or we should love beautiful inanimate things more passionately than we do .
Failing a sustained return it welcomes a temporary coincidence .
When he was in bed , however , sentiment came upon him again in a torrent quite abruptly and abundantly , and he put his head under the pillow and whispered very softly , `` I love Ann Pornick , '' as a sort of supplementary devotion .
Then we think of each other . ''
He heard them speak easily and freely to one another of examinations , of books and paintings , of `` last year 's Academy '' -- a little contemptuously ; and once , just at the end of the class-time , Mr. Chester Coote and young Walshingham and the two girls argued about something or other called , he fancied , `` Vagner '' or `` Vargner '' -- they seemed to say it both ways -- and which presently shaped itself more definitely as the name of a man who made up music .
Kipps , I say , felt himself a creature of outer darkness , an inexcusable intruder in an altitudinous world .
`` I know that , '' said Kipps .
Kipps applauded the situation vehemently .
Kipps sought his moustache .
`` Was n't born yesterday , '' said the old gentleman , and blew .
The figures were uncertain , but the essential facts they had correct .
Kipps was packing his box .
All the rest were quite honestly and simply glad -- gladder perhaps at that time than Kipps because they were not so overpowered ... .
`` Go to Oireland .
`` What 's brought _you_ here ?
`` I 'ave , '' he said ; `` I 've throwed it up . ''
For a moment they hung , evidently disinclined to part .
Kipps went to bed at last with an impression of important things settled , and he lay awake for quite a long time .
Here in the simplest , easiest way was the adapter .
He shook hands with an unreal heartiness and said he was jolly glad .
`` It 's a blooming stroke of Luck , '' he said .
Yet drawn by a sort of fascination he came with Kipps and assisted at the mounting of the motor .
Kipps mounted at once , after one violent agitation of the little shop-door to set the bell a-jingle and warn his Uncle and Aunt .
The young mechanic had just discovered that to have manufactured seventeen bicycles , including orders in hand , is not so big a thing as he had supposed , and such discoveries try one 's manhood ... .
She thrust the blade of her intelligence into the tenderest corners of Kipps ' secret vanity , she slashed his most intimate pride to bleeding tatters .
But the unanticipated made a brave number ... .
Ann smiled at him frankly .
His voice went up to a note of despair , `` And it 's too late to telegrarf and stop 'em ! ''
`` Promise me , '' she had said .
Kipps said he would , and produced his store .
Sid pushed the end of the screen out of his way , sat down on the bed thus frankly admitted , and prepared , with a certain quiet satisfaction of manner , to witness Masterman 's treatment of Kipps .
`` That 's all very well , Masterman , '' he said , `` but , after all , money is Power , you know .
He coughed and paused .
`` It 's nothing , '' he said to Kipps ' note of startled horror .
It occurred to him that the campaign of tipping upon which he had embarked was perhaps after all a mistake .
He was confirmed in this by observing that the hotel officials were watching him , not respectfully , but with a sort of amused wonder , as if to see whom he would tip next .
However , if he backed out now , they would think him an awful fool .
They contemplated realistic groups of plaster savages , and Ann thought they 'd be queer people to have about .
Kipps said at large , it must have been a queer world then , but Ann very properly doubted if they really went about like that .
A great , grey emptiness it was , and it seemed marvellous to them , but not nearly so marvellous as it might have seemed .
`` It 's a bit big for what I meant , '' said Kipps , with a reassuring eye on Ann .
His mackintosh flapped about him , the rain stung his cheek ; for a time he felt a hardy man .
And then as abruptly the rain ceased and the wind fell , and before he was through Sandgate High Street it was a bright spring day .
`` I did n't see no gentleman with them at all , '' said Ann .
`` I keep on thinking of it , and thinking of it , and what 's to be done and what 's to be done .
I sha n't be any good 'ome s'arfernoon .
I 'd be no comfort to you , Ann .
My fingers is all atwitch .
The Food of the Gods ,
`` Yes , '' I said with assurance ; `` I could eat some mutton . ''
I did my Biology at University College , -- getting out the ovary of the earthworm and the radula of the snail , and all that .
Overboard , Mister Shut-up , -- and sharp !
We 're cleaning the ship out , -- cleaning the whole blessed ship out ; and overboard you go ! ''
`` I daresay you are , '' said Montgomery , in anything but a cordial tone .
Farther up the beach stared the Beast Men .
said I , pointing to them and raising my voice more and more that it might reach them .
He came forward and took my arm .
He pocketed his weapon , felt my arm about painfully , and led me inside .
Montgomery lay on his back , with the hairy-grey Beast-man sprawling across his body .
Near by lay M'ling on his face and quite still , his neck bitten open and the upper part of the smashed brandy-bottle in his hand .
ALONE WITH THE BEAST FOLK .
I came out of the bushes , and , revolver in hand , walked down towards these seated figures .
One , a Wolf-woman , turned her head and stared at me , and then the others .
None attempted to rise or salute me .
During that time they respected the usage established by the Law , and behaved with general decorum .
And they walked erect with an increasing difficulty .
I realised more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about the `` stubborn beast-flesh . ''
He reflected and experimented in a way that made the engine scold and fuss ... .
`` Out of the Sunday Supplement , '' said the youthful Britling .
He detested the way he wore his hair and the peculiar cut of his knickerbockers and -- him .
There followed a digression upon the Boy Scout movement , and Mr. Direck made comparisons with the propaganda of Seton Thompson in America .
`` Colonel Teddyism , '' said Manning .
But whenever other traffic or any indication of a side way appeared discretion returned .
They rounded another corner , and still more steeply the hill rose before them .
None the less they are misery .
He kept on turning over and then turning over again , and sitting up and lying back , like a martyr on a gridiron ... .
It became relevant to the trend of his thoughts that his son had through his mother a strong strain of the dark Irish in his composition .
`` _I_ think that is it .
I think that I do want a religious marriage , and that what is wrong with Teddy and Letty is that they are n't religious .
`` I never thought of you as a soldier before , '' said Teddy .
exclaimed Aunt Wilshire after an interval of accumulation ... .
`` They say he has completely lost the use of the joint in his left arm , he carries it stiff like a Punch and Judy -- and he wants to conquer Europe ... .
He stood in Awe of her .
Even his uncle had some influence .
Now , nothing restrains him .
Probably a friend of Lady Frensham 's , he thought .
`` I think killing people or getting killed is a thoroughly nasty habit ... .
I expect my share will be just drilling and fatigue duties and route marches , and loafing here in England ... . ''
It was n't as it had seemed at first , the end of one human phase and the beginning of another ; it was in itself a phase .
It was a new way of living .
And still he could find no real point of contact for himself with it all except the point of his pen .
Yet he was always desiring some more personal and physical participation .
They do not happen at Matching 's Easy ... .
She had asked to see him .
He will die -- without dignity ... . ''
We do n't know how to darn socks .
Hugh told the story with the unblushing _savoir-faire_ of the very young .
As one has known it . ''
She added : `` Letty has gone to telegraph . ''
He 's one of the men the young officers talk about .
The youngster was right in the front now , and one had to steel oneself to the possibilities of the case .
Somehow Mr. Britling had not expected to find Hugh so speedily in the firing line , though he would have been puzzled to find a reason why this should not have happened .
`` Oh -- sympathy !
`` The Women 's Association for the Extirpation of the whole breed of War Lords , '' she threw out .
His mind came back presently from these wanderings to the task before him .
He may have his friendships , his partial loyalties , his scraps of honour .
Of course I must write about Him .
I must tell all my world of Him .
And before the coming of the true King , the inevitable King , the King who is present whenever just men foregather , this blood-stained rubbish of the ancient world , these puny kings and tawdry emperors , these wily politicians and artful lawyers , these men who claim and grab and trick and compel , these war makers and oppressors , will presently shrivel and pass -- like paper thrust into a flame ... . ''
One might smoke up the chimney , he reflected .
But he had no cigarettes !
Perhaps if he were to slip downstairs ... .
She had always helped where she could in her husband 's public work , and she had been popular upon her own merits in Wealdstone .
The portrait was abominable enough in itself ; it dwelt on her chin , doubled her age , and denied her gentleness , but it was a mere starting-point for the subtle extravagance of The Snicker's poisonous gift ... .
It was probably the bright hard spring sunshine that emphasized the contrast between that dear England of hedges and homes and the south-west wind in which his imagination lived , and the crude presences of a mechanical age .
He saw her very vividly as he had seen her in the dining-room , slender and upright , half child , half woman , so fragile and so fearless .
The writer boldly charged the `` Christian churches '' with absolute ineffectiveness .
This war , he declared , was above all other wars a war of ideas , of material organization against rational freedom , of violence against law ; it was a war more copiously discussed than any war had ever been before , the air was thick with apologetics .
And what was the voice of the church amidst these elemental issues ?
Where was the blessing of the church , where was the veto of the church ?
When it came to that one discovered only a broad preoccupied back busied in supplementing the Army Medical Corps with Red Cross activities , good work in its way -- except that the canonicals seemed superfluous .
`` He 's vicar of Wombash -- in my diocese , '' said the bishop with restraint .
You 'd go somewhere where there was a good Anglican chaplain , and you 'd take some of the services yourself .
With a sigh of deep relief the bishop realized that this world had vanished .
The Three Creeds were like garments flung aside .
Do you really believe -- anything ? ''
Eighty years ago it warmed the whole Church .
It was -- as some atheist or other put it the other day -- the central heating of the soul .
Consider the essential question , the question of breaking with the church .
Ask yourself , whither would you go ?
To become an oddity !
You would just cease to serve Religion .
That would be all .
But it will weigh .
A man who has held the position of a bishop for some years is , he held , no longer a free man in matters of opinion .
He may get his own soul clear , but what will happen to them ?
He did not sleep indeed very badly , but he lay for some time thinking , thinking not onward but as if he pressed his mind against very strong barriers that had closed again .
Creeds may be symbolical , but symbols must not prevaricate .
A church that can symbolize everything and anything means nothing .
He glanced at his watch .
He wanted to muddle on for just a little longer .
He wanted to stay just where he was , in his familiar prison-house , with the key of escape in his hand .
`` The God I saw in my vision -- He is not yet manifest in the world ? ''
What was she doing here ?
I seem to see you not there at all , not in anything between west-end and suburb , but yourself as central as your mind , in a kind of clergy house that will be part of the building .
I just want to offer .
Here I am and all my worldly goods .
And you have no right to refuse me .
You have to go on with your message , and it is your duty to take me -- just as you are obliged to step on any steppingstone that lies on your way to do God service ... .
And so I am waiting .
I know you will take your time and think .
But do not take too much time .
`` He did me no particular harm , '' said Scrope .
When water was added it became streaked and opalescent , with a kind of living quiver in it .
Dreadfully hard to get 'em to do anything .
The architect would be so free that --
`` They must not come between God and me ... . ''
`` He 's outside . ''
He paused and looked at them .
He dropped to the conversational note again .
His mind was too excited , he knew , for any hope of sleep .
Surely that work was finished now , and the day 's experience had drawn the veil and discovered God established for ever .
There was a sharp exclamation , the shriek of a woman , and the crowd came surging back .
But that was not it really !
It was a dramatic sort of thing to take .
I had , I say , no plan at all .
She did not answer , but I heard her dress rustle as she moved .
I Judged she was upon the landing overhead .
`` Do not be distressed at my going away .
Love is a very difficult thing , and takes hold of one in ways one does not expect .
Do not think I am ashamed about this , I glory in my love , and you must not trouble too much about me .
What was the sense of saying `` peace '' when there was no peace ?
If there was one hope in the disorders of that old world it lay in revolt and conflict to the death .
After our midday dinner -- it was a potato-pie , mostly potato with some scraps of cabbage and bacon -- I put on my overcoat and got it out of the house while my mother was in the scullery at the back .
The front door closed and he returned .
That was all right !
At the Crest I looked back .
That , science said , would be all .
Indeed I gripped his arm and shook him .
Then he turned upon me cursing .
The man who had first come out shouted , `` Do n't you hear the guns ?
There was , first , the ancient system of `` ownership '' that made such an extraordinary tangle of our administration of the land upon which we lived .
In the old time no one believed in that as either just or ideally convenient , but every one accepted it .
All the rest of the land was cut up in the maddest way into patches and oblongs and triangles of various sizes between a hundred square miles and a few acres , and placed under the nearly absolute government of a series of administrators called landowners .
If the community needed a road or a tramway , if it wanted a town or a village in any position , nay , even if it wanted to go to and fro , it had to do so by exorbitant treaties with each of the monarchs whose territory was involved .
No man could find foothold on the face of the earth until he had paid toll and homage to one of them .
This sounds , I know , like a lunatic 's dream , but mankind was that lunatic ; and not only in the old countries of Europe and Asia , where this system had arisen out of the rational delegation of local control to territorial magnates , who had in the universal baseness of those times at last altogether evaded and escaped their duties , did it obtain , but the `` new countries , '' as we called them then -- the United States of America , the Cape Colony , Australia , and New Zealand -- spent much of the nineteenth century in the frantic giving away of land for ever to any casual person who would take it .
And Nettie cried , `` Willie ! ''
I held out a forgiving hand , naively forgetful that in this place I was a thief , and he took it and went his way , shaking his head and repeating he was ashamed , but I think a little comforted .
There remained for her but a very brief while in this world that had been renewed .
I took care to be constantly with her , for I perceived now her curious need of me .
There was no toil for her any more in the world , but only such light services as are easy and pleasant for a worn and weary old woman to do , and I think she was happy even at her end .
People passed praying between the fires , and it was a fine symbol of the new and wiser tolerance that had come to men , that those who still found their comfort in the orthodox faiths came hither unpersuaded , to pray that all hate might be burnt out of their professions .
For even in the fires of Baal , now that men have done with base hatred , one may find the living God .
But , so far as Dunstone goes , that is not the case .
And in a moment of confidence he spoke of her .
Let the reader take a pen in hand and sit down and write , `` My very dear wife . ''
Try now , `` Migh verrie deare Wyfe . ''
Such spelling is a soft , domestic , lovingly wasteful use of material .
why pump-water and inferior champagne , spirits of nitrous ether and pancreatic juice are `` sweet . ''
For my own part I always spell so , with lots of f 's and g 's and such like tailey , twirley , loopey things , when my heart is in the tender vein .
And I hold that a man who will not do so , now he has been shown how to do it , is , in plain English , neither more nor less than a prig .
It would be almost as reasonable to debate whether Shakespeare smiled or frowned .
He is `` Sims , '' a mere slash of the pen , to those he scorns , Simmonds or Simmongs to his familiars , and Simmons , A.T. Simmons , Esq.
The further visions of the Professor are less alluring .
Hear him upon one 's social duties -- this living soul in this world of wonders !
And everyone should try to master some instrument or other .
One may get quite a little reputation as an entertainer with these things . ''
`` Yet so set at times is your gambler upon his abominable pursuit , '' says Bagarrow , `` that in practice even this ingenious expedient has been known to fail . ''
I remember that on another occasion he went out of his way to promise a partially intoxicated man a drink ; and taking him into a public-house ordered two lemon squashes !
He liked lemon squash himself and he did not like beer , and he thought he had only to introduce the poor fallen creature to the delights of temperance to ensure his conversion there and then .
I think he expected the man to fall upon him , crying `` My benefactor ! ''
It sounds very unpleasant .
Then the professional nature-lover assumes that you know trees .
It will be some time yet before the rising of the moon .
How tightly these white sepulchres are packed here !
The dead are crammed together as closely as the living seemed in that bird's-eye view from the Archway .
There is no ample shadow of trees , no tangled corners where mother earth may weave flower garlands over her returning children .
The monuments positively jostle and elbow each other for frontage upon the footways .
And they are so rawly clean and assertive .
Most of them are conspicuously new whitened , with freshly-blackened or newly-gilt inscriptions , bare of lichen , moss , or mystery , and altogether so restless that it seems to the meditative man that the struggle for existence , for mere standing room and a show in the world , still rages among the dead .
The unstable slope of the hill , with its bristling array of obelisks , crosses and urns , craning one above another , is as directly opposed to the restfulness of the village churchyard with its serene outspreading yews as midday Fleet Street to a Sabbath evening amidst the Sussex hills .
This cemetery is , indeed , a veritable tumult of tombs .
I had more imagination than Maxton and was a good deal better read , so that Mary and I dominated most of the games of Indians and warfare and exploration in which we passed our long days together .
When the Christians were at Burnmore , and they usually spent three or four months in the year there , I had a kind of standing invitation to be with them .
Then a little later than this meeting in the pavilion , though I am not clear now whether it was the same or some subsequent afternoon , we are walking in the sunken garden , and great clouds of purple clematis and some less lavish heliotrope-colored creeper , foam up against the ruddy stone balustrading .
Just in front of us a fountain gushes out of a grotto of artificial stalagmite and bathes the pedestal of an absurd little statuette of the God of Love .
To this day a dewy morning in late August brings back the thought of Mary and those stolen meetings .
Presently came the sunrise , blinding , warming , dew-dispelling arrows of gold smiting through the tree stems , a flood of light foaming over the bracken and gilding the under sides of the branches .
Everything is different and distinctive in those opening hours ; everything has a different value from what it has by day .
Am I beautiful , my dear ?
Am I beautiful in the moonlight ?
Our heads were close together ; her eyelashes swept my cheek , we spoke rarely and in soft whispers , and our hearts were beating , beating .
We were as solemn as great mountains and as innocent as sleeping children .
Give me a chance .
Give me three years , Mary , three short years , to work , to do something ! ''
`` Only from impossible things . ''
In a moment I was afoot and called out to the men , my philosophy , my deep questionings , all torn out of my mind like a page of scribbled poetry plucked out of a business note-book .
Khaki figures were up all about me passing the word and hurrying to their places .
When I was a boy , there were n't any Germans .
They came up after '70 .
And statesmen from Birmingham !
I was full of the idea that now she must inevitably be mine .
I had visions of our going forth , hand in hand .
Outside was the soughing of a coming storm , a chill wind drove a tumult of leaves along the terrace , the door slammed and yawned open again , and then came the rain .
She had not realized how great were the forces against her and against us both .
She let fall a phrase that suggested she was ill. She had given in , she said , to save herself and myself and others from the shame and ruin of a divorce , and I must give in too .
She knew , she said , she seemed to desert me , but I did not know everything , -- I did not know everything , -- I must agree ; she could not come with me ; it was impossible .
If I knew all I should be the readier to understand and forgive her , but it was part of the conditions that I could not know all .
Those letters had a quality I had never before met in her , they were broken-spirited .
He stopped and held out his hand .
The first expedient of enterprise was the sword and then the whip , and still there are remote and ugly corners of the world , in the Mexican Valle Nazionale or in Portuguese South Africa , where the whip whistles still and the threat of great suffering and death follows hard upon the reluctant toiler .
We have fallen into methods at once more subtle and more effective .
We stand benevolently in front of our fellow man , offering , almost as if it were food and drink and shelter and love , the work we want him to do ; and behind him , we are acutely aware , is necessity , sometimes quite of our making , as when we drive him to work by a hut-tax or a poll tax or a rent , that obliges him to earn money , and sometimes not so obviously of our making , sometimes so little of our making that it is easy to believe we have no power to remove it .
We had branches in China , Japan , Peru , Iceland and a thousand remote places that would have sounded as far off as the moon to an English or American bookseller in the seventies .
China in particular was a growing market .
Incidentally we had bought up some thousands of miles of Labrador forest to ensure our paper supply , and we could believe that before we died there would not be a corner of the world in which any book of interest or value whatever would not be easily attainable by any intelligent person who wanted to read it .
And already we were taking up the more difficult and ambitious phase of our self-appointed task , and considering the problem of using these channels we were mastering and deepening and supplementing for the stimulation and wide diffusion of contemporary thought .
One gets angry -- like an animal . ''
Sharp 's the word._ ''
When Mr. Lewisham was not looking over the top of his book during these periods of open-air study , then commonly he was glancing over his shoulder .
And at last who should he see but -- !
-- if he assured her that it was so ?
The feet down the lane stopped close at hand .
The day after that mood a new `` text '' attracted and perplexed Mrs. Munday , an inscription at once mysterious and familiar , and this inscription was :
But this gloss ... '' You would have looked nearer , and finally you would have touched -- a charnel-house surface , dank and cool !
It was the only collar he had in the world , it saved threepence a week at least , and that , to a South Kensington `` science teacher in training , '' living on the guinea a week allowed by a parental but parsimonious government , is a sum to consider .
I know I can help you .
So it was Lewisham enrolled his first ally in the cause of the red tie -- of the red tie and of the Greatness that was presently to come .
His first ally ; for hitherto -- save for the indiscretion of his mural inscriptions -- he had made a secret of his private ambitions .
`` I say _no_ ! ''
The question interests me profoundly .
Am I a -- fool , or an impostor ? ''
Along the cornices were busts of Plato , Socrates , and Newton .
Behind Ethel was the great man 's desk with its green-shaded electric light , and littered with proofs and copies of _Hesperus_ , `` A Paper for Doubters , '' which , with her assistance , he edited , published , compiled , wrote , and ( without her help ) paid for and read .
Mr. Lagune had flung it down .
`` But you have _passed_ all right , '' she said .
Her customary tenderness was veiled by an only too apparent resentment .
`` I suppose it _has_ to be , '' she said .
`` Of course , it does n't matter , I suppose , if we _don't_ see each other quite so often , '' with a quiver of pale lips .
`` We are excellent friends , '' admitted Lewisham .
`` Do n't you see that is the only thing for us ?
`` I was in -- I was one of those who arranged the exposure , '' said Lewisham .
And I do n't think you have said anything so far to show that spiritualistic cheating is Right . ''
Those were the days before the violent competition of the half-educated had brought things down to an impossible tenpence the thousand words , and the prevailing price was as high as one-and-six .
It was evident Ethel also must advertise .
He returned to his lodgings in a hopeful mood with quite a bundle of memoranda of possible employments .
`` It 's a fair game . ''
`` Dear , dear ! ''
he said at last .
`` Miss Heydinger . ''
Their common fault is to be comprehensively jejune .
That which is the blood and warmth and reality of life is largely absent ; there are no individualities , but only generalised people .
Too often the prospect resembles the key to one of those large pictures of coronations , royal weddings , parliaments , conferences , and gatherings so popular in Victorian times , in which , instead of a face , each figure bears a neat oval with its index number legibly inscribed .
It has ripened , it has been christened with blood , it has been stained and mellowed by handling , it has been rounded and dented to the softened contours that we associate with life ; it has been salted , maybe , in a brine of tears .
On our own poor haphazard earth , wherever men work , wherever there are things to be grown , minerals to be won , power to be used , there , regardless of all the joys and decencies of life , the households needs must cluster .
But in Utopia there will be wide stretches of cheerless or unhealthy or toilsome or dangerous land with never a household ; there will be regions of mining and smelting , black with the smoke of furnaces and gashed and desolated by mines , with a sort of weird inhospitable grandeur of industrial desolation , and the men will come thither and work for a spell and return to civilisation again , washing and changing their attire in the swift gliding train .
And then a sweet-voiced bell from somewhere high up towards Oberalp chimes two-and-twenty times .
`` But how could I go back to my laboratory , mixed classes with young ladies , you know , after a thing like that ?
Do n't think I'm timid or conventional .
The difference between the social and economic sciences as they exist in our world [ Footnote : But see Gidding 's Principles of Sociology , a modern and richly suggestive American work , imperfectly appreciated by the British student .
and in this Utopia deserves perhaps a word or so more .
The vital nature of economic issues to a Utopia necessitates , however , some attempt at interpretation between the two .
`` We have come so far that this country of yours seems very strange indeed to us . ''
But these houses and tramways and things , all made from ore and stuff torn from her veins -- -- !
You ca n't better my image of the rash .
I 'd give it all for one -- what is it ?
-- free and natural chamois . ''
`` You 're joking , '' she suggests .
The sentimental factor in the case rarely leads to more than a solitary child or at most two to a marriage , and with a high and rising standard of comfort and circumspection it is unlikely that the birth-rate will ever rise very greatly again .
The Utopians will hold that if you keep the children from profitable employment for the sake of the future , then , if you want any but the exceptionally rich , secure , pious , unselfish , or reckless to bear children freely , you must be prepared to throw the cost of their maintenance upon the general community .
These things make an old story to me , and perhaps explicitness suffers through my brevity .
`` I saw her , '' he explains .
In our barbaric past horrible flayed carcases of brutes dripping blood , were hung for sale in the public streets . ''
He shrugged his shoulders .
`` I should have thought , '' I said , `` a class of women who traded on their sex would have arisen , women , I mean , who found an interest and an advantage in emphasising their individual womanly beauty .
I grip his arm .
`` Be sensible , '' I say , speaking very quickly , and with my back to the approaching couple .
There will be many Utopias .
Until at last from dreams Utopias will have come to be working drawings , and the whole world will be shaping the final World State , the fair and great and fruitful World State , that will only not be a Utopia because it will be this world .
( See also Chapter I. , Section 6 , and Chapter X. , Sections 1 and 2 . )
This insistence upon the element of uniqueness in being , this subordination of the class to the individual difference , not only destroys the universal claim of philosophy , but the universal claim of ethical imperatives , the universal claim of any religious teaching .
If you press me back upon my fundamental position I must confess I put faith and standards and rules of conduct upon exactly the same level as I put my belief of what is right in art , and what I consider right practice in art .
`` He will probably be able to assuage your pain , '' said the Vicar .
`` Let me assist you to remove your coat ? ''
`` My wife came home in a dreadful state , '' he brayed out at long range .
It 's beyond dispute .
In my own mind .
But after the behaviour of these people .
Nowadays people are so very particular about evidence .
Of course there is no knowing how or when you may go back .
After what has happened ( _Gluck_ , _gluck_ , _gluck_ -- as the Vicar refills his glass ) -- after what has happened I should not be surprised to see the side of the room fall away , and the hosts of heaven appear to take you away again -- take us both away even .
It will certainly be wiser to break the thing gently to them . ''
`` Where 's that ? ''
`` Ver well , '' he said , as one who decides great issues .
The Curate from Iping Hanger ( who was professionally a Kelt and who played the piano and talked colour and music with an air of racial superiority ) watched him jealously .
`` He can not play from Notes ! ''
said Lady Hammergallow in a voice of measured horror .
`` Non -- sense ! ''
`` What HAVE I done ? ''
This was not so very remarkable -- once before he had missed the midday meal .
Yet , considering how short was the time they would have together now , he might perhaps have come back .
The Vicar made an indifferent lunch .
In the afternoon he rested in his usual manner , and did a little more to the list of requirements .
He did not begin to feel nervous about the Angel till tea-time .
He waited , perhaps , half an hour before he took tea .
`` Odd , '' said the Vicar , feeling still more lonely as he drank his tea .
The possibilities of the ocean-going submarine I will not enlarge upon now .
Those great teachings of the past were spread largely by word of mouth .
Few people could read , fewer still could translate , and MSS .
were copied with extreme slowness upon parchment .
There was no printing , no paper , no post .
It would be impossible to imagine a feebler attempt .
I read , therefore , with great avidity during my adolescence .
You will , if you will examine them , find that disregard working out to its natural consequences in what are called the `` advanced '' schools that appeal to educationally anxious parents nowadays .
You will find these schools adorned with attractive diagrams drawn by the teachers , and strikingly original models and apparatus made by the teachers , and if you look closely into the matter or consult an intelligent pupil , you will find there are never enough diagrams and apparatus to see a course through .
No school , however rich and prosperous and however enthusiastically run , can hope to make for itself all the plant and diagrams and apparatus needed for a fully efficient modern education such as we have sketched out .

China was lit glowing white , but over Japan and Java and all the islands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming .
Above was the lava , hot gases and ash , and below the seething floods , and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks .
And in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to that one last hope of men -- the open sea .
But the patter came nearer , they were not feeding as they wandered , but going fast -- or else they would not overtake her -- and she caught the limb of a tree , swung on to it , and ran up the stem with something of the agility of a monkey .
The aim of the third , that fell the night after , however , was better .
She began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about Andoo .
For a space she stood still , looking about her and making a low continuous sound that was almost a moan .
`` What 's up now ? ''
She turned to the distant reed-bed , as sometimes she had turned to Uya in his life .
And , as if in answer , the tall reeds bowed before a breath of wind .

They were both very hungry and footsore -- for walking was a rare exercise -- and presently they sat down on the weedless , close-cropped grass , and looked back for the first time at the city from which they had come , shining wide and splendid in the blue haze of the valley of the Thames .
Elizabeth was a little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the slope -- she had never been near big unrestrained animals before -- but Denton reassured her .

He was transferred to the care of a rather more elaborate press in the central factory of the London Tile Trust .

He insisted that a doctor was paid to cure people -- he laid great stress on `` _paid_ '' -- and had no business to glance even for a moment at `` those other questions . ''
`` But we do , '' said the young man , insisting upon facts , and Bindon lost his temper .

For a moment he thought impossible things .

She still had her bonnet on , her purse in her hand , and her little brown basket upon her arm .

`` Here am I , come four hundred miles out of my way to get what is left of the folk-lore of these people , before they are utterly demoralised by missionaries and the military , and all I find are a lot of impossible legends about a sandy-haired scrub of an infantry lieutenant .

On the water of the broad , quiet pool which the treasure seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves and a waxen , pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily .
Further , as the river bent away from them , the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in a rapid .
