In Boston , William T. Ball , one of the leading theatrical critics during the late 90 's , asserted that it was originally written by an English actor ( name not divulged ) who gave it to him .
It was in the famous summer of 1876 , too , that Mark was putting the finishing touches to Tom Sawyer .
The result was 'Fireside Conversation in the Time of Queen Elizabeth ' , or as he later called it , '1601 ' .
`` It was written as a letter , '' continues Paine , `` to that robust divine , Rev .
The story of the first issue of 1601 is one of finesse , state diplomacy , and surreptitious printing .
The following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name of John Hay known throughout the world .
DEPARTMENT OF STATE Washington , June 21 , 1880 .
Yours , very much worritted by the depravity of Christendom , Hay The second letter discloses Hay 's own high opinion of the effort and his deep concern for its safety .
He has not yet been able even to find a publisher .
Read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me ; for Mark is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring .
He came from the banks of the Mississippi -- from the flatboatmen , pilots , roustabouts , farmers and village folk of a rude , primitive people -- as Lincoln did .
Frank Harris in My Life , Vol .
XIII , tells of Lady Marriott , wife of a judge Advocate General , being compelled to leave her own table , at which she was entertaining Sir Robert Fowler , then the Lord Mayor of London , because of the suffocating and nauseating odors there .
He also tells of an instance in parliament , and of a rather brilliant bon mot spoken upon that occasion .
The question is what to believe , for much that we have heard about her is almost certainly apocryphal .
He went alone , but in November returned with the purpose of taking Mrs. Clemens and the new baby , Susy , to England the following spring .
He returned to his family in January , 1874 .
He remained in Cincinnati that winter ( 1856-57 ) working at his trade .
MY DEAR BROTHER , -- Wasson got here night before last `` from the wars . ''
He says the whites left their stone fort before he and Lieut .

Evans assumed the chief command -- and next morning the forces were divided into three parties , and marched against the enemy .
Col. Mayfield was killed , and Sergeant Gillespie , also Noble 's colonel was wounded .
If that rock came from a well-defined ledge , that particular vein must be at least an inch wide , judging from this specimen , which is fully that thick .

Only extracts from these letters are given .
Furthermore , Webb had the Frog book in press , and would issue it May 1st .
Clemens , therefore , returned to New York in April , and now once more being urged by the Californians to lecture , he did not refuse .
Frank Fuller , formerly Governor of Utah , took the matter in hand and engaged Cooper Union for the venture .
DEAR FOLKS , I suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night , and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably glad of it .
It really seemed to me a falling from grace , the idea of going back to San Francisco nothing better than a mere postmaster , albeit the public would have thought I came with gilded honors , and in great glory .
He is always thinking about something .
He is a patient , good little baby .
I love you and Harmony , and that is all the fresh news I 've got , anyway .
These were the days when the Howells and Clemens families began visiting back and forth between Boston and Hartford , and sometimes Aldrich came , though less frequently , and the gatherings at the homes of Warner and Clemens were full of never-to-be-forgotten happiness .
MY DEAR HOWELLS , -- It is n't the Atlantic audience that distresses me ; for it is the only audience that I sit down before in perfect serenity ( for the simple reason that it does n't require a `` humorist '' to paint himself striped and stand on his head every fifteen minutes . )
I was able to read the English edition of the Greville Memoirs through without interruption , take my meals in bed , neglect all business without a pang , and smoke 18 cigars a day .

If there is anything really funny in the piece , the author is not aware of it .
And it seemed to me that now that the fourth act is so successfully written , why not go ahead and write the 3 preceding acts ?
And then after it is finished , let me put into it a low-comedy character ( the girl 's or the lover 's father or uncle ) and gobble a big pecuniary interest in your work for myself .
And do n't go and sell it to anybody , like Harte , but keep it for yourself .

Aunt Marsh and Cousin May Marsh were here visiting Susie Crane and Livy at our farmhouse .
By and by mother Langdon came up the hill in the `` high carriage '' with Nora the nurse and little Jervis ( Charley Langdon's little boy ) -- Timothy the coachman driving .
Behind these came Charley's wife and little girl in the buggy , with the new , young , spry , gray horse -- a high-stepper .
Miss Ellen Emerson replied for her father ( in a letter to Mrs. Clemens ) that the speech had made no impression upon him , giving at considerable length the impression it had made on herself and other members of the family .

There was an Australian there ( a student from Stuttgart or somewhere , ) and Joe told him who I was and he laid himself out to make our course plain , for us -- so I am certain we ca n't get lost between here and Heidelberg .
Livy and all of us send deluges of love to you and Harmony and all the children .
I dreamed last night that I woke up in the library at home and your children were frolicing around me and Julia was sitting in my lap ; you and Harmony and both families of Warners had finished their welcomes and were filing out through the conservatory door , wrecking Patrick's flower pots with their dress skirts as they went .
We all join in the sincerest love to you , and in the kindest remembrance to `` Jock '' -- [ Son of Doctor Brown . ]
At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl Club .
There is but a brief mention of it in the letter to Orion , and the letter itself is not worth preserving , but as references to the `` machine '' appear with increasing frequency , it seems proper to record here its first mention .
In the same letter he suggests to his brother that he undertake an absolutely truthful autobiography , a confession in which nothing is to be withheld .
He cites the value of Casanova 's memories , and the confessions of Rousseau .
They were children with me , and afterwards schoolmates .
The two were never anything but the best of friends .
I know nothing whatever about the Bank Note Co. , and never did know anything about it .

ELMIRA , July 21 , 1885 .
If the N. Y. C. have not previously filed in the several police offices along the border , proof of ownership of the originals of the bonds , the government officials must collect a duty on the counterfeits , and then let them go ahead and circulate in this country .
The slip you sent me from the May `` Study '' has delighted Mrs. Clemens and me to the marrow .
The longer I live the clearer I perceive how unmatchable , how unapproachable , a compliment one pays when he says of a man `` he has the courage ( to utter ) his convictions . ''
Well , that 's loss .
But there are compensations .
Truly yours , S. L. CLEMENS .
I then left there and called on a new bride , who received me in her dressing-gown ; and as things went pretty well , I stayed to luncheon .
And now at last I arrive at my object and tender my petition , making supplication to this effect : that the critics adopt a rule recognizing the Belly and the Members , and formulate a standard whereby work done for them shall be judged .
`` I can never forget , nor be ungrateful for the exquisite pleasure with which I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time , years ago , '' he wrote ; `` I read it again last night , deserting Kenilworth for Huck .
I never laid it down till I had finished it . ''
The play had eventually been produced at the Lyceum Theatre in New York , with A. P. Burbank in the leading role , and Clemens and Howells as financial backers .
Now , however , James A. Herne , a well-known actor and playwright , became interested in the idea , after a discussion of the matter with Howells , and there seemed a probability that with changes made under Herne 's advisement the play might be made sensible and successful .
It will be selling a good thing -- for somebody ; and it will be getting rid of a load which we are clearly not able to carry .
Now , then what is she worth ?
Merry Xmas , my darling , and all my darlings !
I arrived from Chicago close upon midnight last night , and wrote and sent down my Christmas cablegram before undressing : `` Merry Xmas !
Promising progress made in Chicago . ''

But there is n't one which Osteopathy or Kellgren can not cure , if the patient comes early .

To Professor William Lyon Phelps ;
He seems to concede the indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity ( call them what he may , these are exterior forces and not under the man's authority , guidance or even suggestion ) -- then he suddenly flies the logic track and ( to all seeming ) makes the man and not these exterior forces responsible to God for the man 's thoughts , words and acts .
It is frank insanity .
It must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply printed upon a man 's mind , by a single reading , that it will stay long enough to turn up some time or other and be mistaken by him for his own .
Then years afterwards I was talking with Dr. Holmes about it .
To F. N. Doubleday , in New York :

Every time , in 25 years , that I have met Roosevelt the man , a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the hand-grip ; but whenever ( as a rule ) I meet Roosevelt the statesman and politician , I find him destitute of morals and not respectworthy .
It is plain that where his political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing resembling a conscience ; that under those inspirations he is naively indifferent to the restraints of duty and even unaware of them ; ready to kick the Constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way ; and whenever he smells a vote , not only willing but eager to buy it , give extravagant rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own pocket or the party 's , but out of the nation 's , by cold pillage .
By his own standard .
Now the old fever all came back ; the fascinations of the game superseded even his interest in the daily dictations .
DEAR SIR , -- You say `` I often owe my best sermons to a suggestion received in reading or from other exterior sources . ''
We must change it to -- '' I owe all my thoughts , sermons and ideas to suggestions received from sources outside of myself . ''
The simplified English of this proposition is -- '' No man 's brains ever originated an idea . ''
It is an astonishing thing that after all these ages the world goes on thinking the human brain machinery can originate a thought .
To Mrs. H. H. Rogers , in Fair Hawn , Mass .
General Grant did not act like that .
He said if all the confederate soldiers had followed my example and adopted my military arts he could never have caught enough of them in a bunch to inconvenience the Rebellion .
Indeed your cheap-postage victory , achieved in spite of a quarter-century of determined opposition , is good and rational prophecy that you will .
It is lively up here now .
I wish you could come .
`` Oh , it 's been using him just the same ; it could n't change its way of using him if it wanted to , for he would n't let it . ''
Come , this is exciting . ''
In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their great kinsman .

`` I would rather wait -- till he comes . ''
`` You 'll have the chance .

`` Oh , do n't -- do n't say that .
We old operators , go by order and system -- no helter-skelter business with us .
What 's the next thing on the docket ?
The carrying on of the materialization -- the bringing it down to date .
`` No , I should n't call it that , '' said Sellers , who was now placidly walking up and down the room with his hands under his coat-tails and listening to himself talk .
Your term is right -- perfectly right -- I grant that -- but the application is wrong .
It makes a great difference .
Yes , he is a marvelous character .
He was about to begin a remark when -- when he did n't .
We have all been there .
As the door closed behind him those two were standing side by side , looking at that door -- looking at it in a waiting , second-counting , but deeply grateful kind of way .
`` Very well , then .
As I said , this one was not a favorite in the family , and so he was neglected in every way , never sent to school , always allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters , and so of course he has grown up a rude , vulgar , ignorant , dissipated ruffian , and -- ''

And by and by , when the sun made me drowsy , I lay down on my face on top of the coach , grasping the slender iron railing , and slept for an hour or more .
There is not a tree of any kind in the deserts , for hundreds of miles -- there is no vegetation at all in a regular desert , except the sage-brush and its cousin the `` greasewood , '' which is so much like the sage-brush that the difference amounts to little .
Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be impossible but for the friendly sage-brush .
Jack , from this spot where we stand , to Egypt , stretches a fearful desert three hundred miles in extent -- and across that desert that wonderful man brought the children of Israel !
-- guiding them with unfailing sagacity for forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing rocks and hills , and landed them at last , safe and sound , within sight of this very spot ; and where we now stand they entered the Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing !
It was a wonderful , wonderful thing to do , Jack !
Think of it ! ''
But do n't you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that always happens ?
Indeed it is so .
Sure enough , it was just as I had dreaded , he started in to climb the tree -- -- ''
The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man , brimful of spirit and endurance .
The rider 's dress was thin , and fitted close ; he wore a `` round-about , '' and a skull-cap , and tucked his pantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider .
He carried no arms -- he carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary , for even the postage on his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter .
Murders were done in open day , and with sparkling frequency , and nobody thought of inquiring into them .
But at last a Gentile said , 'Go to Brigham Young !
I did not think much of the idea , for if the law could not help me , what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with either making the laws or executing them ?
But what was a man to do ?
I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else , he might probably be able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two , and so I went straight to him and laid the whole case before him .
He said very little , but he showed strong interest all the way through .
Then he made a list of the contractors ' names .
We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the coach .
It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs of life ; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips we finally brought him to a languid consciousness .
The Secretary and I took quarters in the `` ranch '' of a worthy French lady by the name of Bridget O'Flannigan , a camp follower of his Excellency the Governor .
`` Gentlemen , I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you -- a service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes , and afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by observation and study .
These assessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into the matter personally .
There were one or two Overland stage drivers there , also , and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers ; consequently the house was well crowded .
`` Wha-what do you know a -- about Pennsylvania ?
We really had nothing to say .
And the sheriffs promptly echoed it .
Presently the General elbowed his way through the crowd of spectators , with his arms full of law-books , and on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first respectful recognition of his high official dignity that had ever saluted them , and it trickled pleasantly through his whole system :
And then he went to Europe and traveled .
And when he came back he was never tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England , and the gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain , and the fine cattle he had noticed in the vicinity of Rome .
That 's it -- that 's our little game .
He was always nifty himself , and so you bet you his funeral ai n't going to be no slouch -- solid silver door-plate on his coffin , six plumes on the hearse , and a nigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat -- how 's that for high ?

He never could stand it to see things going wrong .
He 's done more to make this town quiet and peaceable than any man in it .
I 've seen him lick four Greasers in eleven minutes , myself .
If a thing wanted regulating , he war n't a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it , but he would prance in and regulate it himself .
He was down on 'em .
His word was , 'No Irish need apply ! '
And he cleaned 'em , too !

What the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like -- or , indeed , what the Chinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is like -- may be gathered from this item which I printed in the Enterprise while reporting for that paper :
He wanted to borrow forty-six dollars -- twenty-six to take him to San Francisco , and twenty for something else ; to buy some soap with , maybe , for he needed it .
I found I had but little more than the amount wanted , in my pocket ; so I stepped in and borrowed forty-six dollars of a banker ( on twenty days ' time , without the formality of a note ) , and gave it him , rather than walk half a block to the office , where I had some specie laid up .
And yet if any creature had been guileless enough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of `` straight '' whiskey during our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible abstemiousness , in that self-same moment the old man would have spun him to the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath .
He took a level tumblerful of whisky every morning before he put his clothes on -- '' to sweeten his bilgewater , '' he said.
Stalwart and portly ; not a gray hair ; broadbrimmed slouch hat ; semi-sailor toggery of blue navy flannel -- roomy and ample ; a stately expanse of shirt-front and a liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied with a sailor knot ; large chain and imposing seals impending from his fob ; awe-inspiring feet , and `` a hand like the hand of Providence , '' as his whaling brethren expressed it ; wrist-bands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow , out of respect for the warm weather , and exposing hairy arms , gaudy with red and blue anchors , ships , and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink .
At his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate , his terrier `` Fan , '' a creature no larger than a squirrel .
The main part of his daily life was occupied in looking after `` Fan , '' in a motherly way , and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination .
Near by is an interesting ruin -- the meagre remains of an ancient heathen temple -- a place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old bygone days when the simple child of nature , yielding momentarily to sin when sorely tempted , acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it him , and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his grandmother as an atoning sacrifice -- in those old days when the luckless sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical happiness as long as his relations held out ; long , long before the missionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a place heaven is , and how nearly impossible it is to get there ; and showed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what unnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it ; showed him how , in his ignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose ; showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy food for next day with , as compared with fishing for pastime and lolling in the shade through eternal Summer , and eating of the bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature .
How sad it is to think of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful island and never knew there was a hell !

The privileged few who followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime , but the King soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it .
A stranger could have guessed his rank ( although he was so simply and unpretentiously dressed ) by the profound deference paid him by all persons in his vicinity ; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet orders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads ; and by observing how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid `` crowding '' him ( although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon to pass , for that matter ) ; how respectfully they edged out sideways , scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view of their persons to his Majesty , and never putting their hats on until they were well out of the royal presence .
And whenever a joke did fall , their bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to ear .
As Sheriff Cummings was in Gold Hill that afternoon , and as I desired to converse with him about the previous assault , I invited him to my office , and he came .
Although a half hour had passed beyond four o'clock , Mr. Winters had not called , and we both of us began preparing to go home .

Sending for the clothes gained some delay , but not enough .
There were two `` Reigns of Terror , '' if we would but remember it and consider it ; the one wrought murder in hot passion , the other in heartless cold blood ; the one lasted mere months , the other had lasted a thousand years ; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons , the other upon a hundred millions ; but our shudders are all for the `` horrors '' of the minor Terror , the momentary Terror , so to speak ; whereas , what is the horror of swift death by the axe , compared with lifelong death from hunger , cold , insult , cruelty , and heart-break ?
A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over ; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror -- that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves .
They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars .
This would undermine the Church .
After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of grease-jets , and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts .
At this , above the salt , sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families , of both sexes , -- the resident Court , in effect -- sixty-one persons ; below the salt sat minor officers of the household , with their principal subordinates : altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting , and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs , or serving in one capacity or another .
It was a very fine show .
I wanted to see the man , after hearing all this .
He was thirty-four years old , and looked sixty .
He raised his chin and looked us slowly over , in a listless dull way , blinking with the distress of the torchlight , then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us .
`` Even so , fair my lord . ''
`` And so upon a time , after year and day , the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath .
Yes , I was right ; it was husband and wife .
They had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away , and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight ; and even after that , we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks .
-- well , the look of him one might not bear at all , and so I turned away ; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again , and there it is to this day , to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it .
With it came Merlin , and took a front seat on the platform ; he was as good as his word for once .
One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban , but they were there , just the same .
The moment the bells stopped , those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave , and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow , and then it solidified itself , and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to -- well , miles .
`` If the king does not arrive , I will have myself ridden on a rail : if he does I will ride you on a rail instead . ''
Education is a great thing .
This was the same youth who had come to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him , `` If a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle , what ought he to do ? ''
answered up naively and said :
It was a desperate place for him to be in , and might cost him his life , but it was no use to argue with him .
And so I dropped the subject .
`` Ah , brother , 't is nothing -- _such_ hospitality ! ''
The blacksmith was a crushed man .
The noise drew nearer and nearer , and soon the van was drifting under us , on both sides of the water .
Another man started up ; the bridging bough was detected , and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge .
For a while the enemy came thick and fast ; but no matter , the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach .
The king 's spirits rose , his joy was limitless .
Then he descended , barking and coughing , and I followed .
The powwow and racket were prodigious ; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and thick-falling blows .
`` Oh , my child , my darling , it will die !
It has no home , it has no father , no friend , no mother -- ''
But I never had any luck ; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way .
The king was greatly admired , because of his grand physique , but his kingly style was against him , and he was n't salable ; nobody wanted that kind of a slave .
I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price .
No , I was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom I have spoken of , but he had something which I expected would belong to me eventually , if he would but visit us often enough .
`` Yes , King Arthur 's . ''
Well , you did n't get a lick amiss , I reckon .
You been into some other audacious mischief when I was n't around , like enough . ''
This course worked well , and Tom began to groan again .
Sid yawned , stretched , then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort , and began to stare at Tom .
`` Why , he told Jeff Thatcher , and Jeff told Johnny Baker , and Johnny told Jim Hollis , and Jim told Ben Rogers , and Ben told a nigger , and the nigger told me .
There was not a breath stirring .
It was the sleepiest of sleepy days .
Tom said nothing -- went on thinking .
`` I did n't do it , friends , '' he sobbed ; `` 'pon my word and honor I never done it . ''
`` I want to go , too , Tom .
Let 's us go , too , Tom . ''
At breakfast , Monday morning , Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom , and very attentive to his wants .
There was an unusual amount of talk .
In the course of it Aunt Polly said :
`` Oh -- 'course I have n't . ''
After a long and thoughtful silence , Injun Joe said :

They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job , and follow him to `` Number Two , '' wherever that might be .
`` By George , he HAS got something to tell , or he would n't act so ! ''
exclaimed the old man ; `` out with it and nobody here 'll ever tell , lad . ''
AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning , Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman 's door .
`` Why , Huck , I never told on that tavern-keeper .
YOU know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic .
I began to ask questions , but my class-teacher , Mr. Barclay the stone-mason , was reluctant about answering them , it seemed to me .
I was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there was n't another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a thing .
He did not answer my question , but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my age and comprehension .
I will say for Mr. Barclay that he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan 's history , but he stopped there : he wouldn't allow any discussion of them .
Maybe he did all these things , but I would like to know who held the horses in the meantime ; and who studied the books in the garret ; and who frollicked in the law-courts for recreation .
Also , who did the call-boying and the play-acting .

`` Thou'rt a gentle comforter , sweet lady , '' said Tom , gratefully , `` and my heart moveth me to thank thee for't , an ' I may be so bold . ''
Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins , timidly asking leave with his eye , but another silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him .
He made two or three further efforts to help himself , but being promptly forestalled each time , he finally gave up , with a sigh of resignation and a murmured `` Beshrew me , but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also ! ''
Therefore there was but one course to pursue -- find his way to the Guildhall , make himself known , and denounce the impostor .
-- for thee and Nan and Bet -- and honestly come by , not begged nor stolen ! ''
It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious feature , that rank was waived on both sides ; yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had been extended .
The goodwife had intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner , like any other tramp or like a dog ; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had given him , that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters , on ostensible terms of equality with them ; and the King , on his side , was so remorseful for having broken his trust , after the family had been so kind to him , that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family level , instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait upon him , while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and dignity .
`` I see you feel my atmosphere !
None may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected ; for it is the very atmosphere of heaven .
-- and I SHOULD have been pope , for Heaven had said it -- but the King dissolved my religious house , and I , poor obscure unfriended monk , was cast homeless upon the world , robbed of my mighty destiny ! ''
Here he began to mumble again , and beat his forehead in futile rage , with his fist ; now and then articulating a venomous curse , and now and then a pathetic `` Wherefore I am nought but an archangel -- I that should have been pope ! ''
At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife , and nodded his head with satisfaction .
`` Oh , thou'lt break our hearts , thou gentle spirit !
-- God will help us to bear our -- ''
Among these prisoners was an old lawyer -- a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien .
The chronicler says , 'At the upper end of Gracechurch Street , before the sign of the Eagle , the city had erected a gorgeous arch , beneath which was a stage , which stretched from one side of the street to the other .
Also , throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way of the young people , so that their honesty could have every chance to harden and solidify , and become a part of their very bone .
The neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy , and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg 's pride in it and call it vanity ; but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in reality an incorruptible town ; and if pressed they would also acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek for responsible employment .
At last he had a fortunate idea , and when it fell into his brain it lit up his whole head with an evil joy .
He began to form a plan at once , saying to himself `` That is the thing to do -- I will corrupt the town . ''
Six months later he went to Hadleyburg , and arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night .
He got a sack out of the buggy , shouldered it , and staggered with it through the cottage yard , and knocked at the door .
A woman 's voice said `` Come in , '' and he entered , and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour , saying politely to the old lady who sat reading the `` Missionary Herald '' by the lamp : `` Pray keep your seat , madam , I will not disturb you .
There -- now it is pretty well concealed ; one would hardly know it was there .
But her curiosity was roused , and she went straight to the sack and brought away the paper .
This sack contains gold coin weighing a hundred and sixty pounds four ounces -- '' `` Mercy on us , and the door not locked ! ''
Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it , then pulled down the window-shades and stood frightened , worried , and wondering if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more safe .
I asked for help -- in the dark ; I was ashamed to beg in the light .
He also gave me fortune ; for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table .
And finally , a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this day , and has at last conquered me ; and in conquering has saved the remnant of my morals : I shall gamble no more .
This is an honest town , an incorruptible town , and I know I can trust it without fear .
If he shall answer , 'I am the man ; the remark I made was so-and-so , ' apply the test -- to wit : open the sack , and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that remark .
I do n't like to be near it ; it seems a defilement . ''
She moved to a farther chair ... `` I wish Edward would come , and take it to the bank ; a burglar might come at any moment ; it is dreadful to be here all alone with it . ''
What have you been getting ?
Then his wife told him the great secret .
It dazed him for a moment ; then he said : `` It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds ?
He was well stirred up now ; cheerful , even gleeful .
Think what a noise it will make !
I must get to the printing-office now , or I shall be too late . ''
Her husband tried to think of some comforting thing to say , and presently came out with this :
The letter was from a distant State , and it said :
Because I wrote that paper . ''
It was Burgess 's turn to be paralysed .
`` Alas , poor Wilson !
`` I beg you not to threaten me , '' said the stranger calmly .
`` I know my legal rights , and am not accustomed to being frightened at bluster . ''
`` Dr. '' Harkness saw an opportunity here .
He was one of the two very rich men of the place , and Pinkerton was the other .
Harkness was proprietor of a mint ; that is to say , a popular patent medicine .
The stake was large , and Harkness was a daring speculator .
He was sitting close to the stranger .
He leaned over while one or another of the other Symbols was entertaining the house with protests and appeals , and asked , in a whisper ,
`` I thought congratulations and praises always tasted good .
But -- it seems to me , now -- Edward ? ''
`` No one has betrayed anything to me -- '' `` -- And then he did a natural and justifiable thing ; he repented of the saving kindness which he had done me , and he EXPOSED me -- as I deserved -- ''
'Well , necessarily it looks pretty barren and unfinished , but -- '
Do you like it ? '
'I got a rag lamp .
But alas and alas !
Yet how stupendous its importance !
Do you know what book that was ? '
I think that that is only a small part of it .
I think that the secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere :
'But he was n't allowed to finish .
Then we scraped together those things which one never parts with until he is betting them against future wealth -- keepsake trinkets and suchlike -- and these we pawned for enough to furnish us a frugal farewell supper and breakfast , and leave us a few francs over for travel , and a stake of turnips and such for Millet to live on for a few days .
The ship burned all night very brightly , and hopes are that some ship has seen the light and is bearing down upon us .
Latitude , Sunday , May 20 , 12 degrees 0 minutes 9 seconds .
They ought to be well out of the doldrums now , but they are not .
It exists , it continues to sparkle , and is well taken care of .
But you are not permitted to try to smuggle it into this discussion , where it is irrelevant and would not feel at home .
Of course , she can decline if she wants to ; but this would be unwise .
No -- to advantage herself .
Your conduct is unheard of , sir !
You forget that you are in a parliament ; you must remember where you are , sir . '
( Applause from the Right .
And so the war of epithets crashes along , with never-diminishing energy , for a couple of hours .
The man was not in uniform , and was not armed .
The thought of him got to preying upon me every night ; I could not get rid of it .
I could not drive it away , the taking of that unoffending life seemed such a wanton thing .
And it seemed an epitome of war ; that all war must be just that -- the killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal animosity ; strangers whom , in other circumstances , you would help if you found them in trouble , and who would help you if you needed it .
My campaign was spoiled .
I resolved to retire from this avocation of sham soldiership while I could save some remnant of my self-respect .
These morbid thoughts clung to me against reason ; for at bottom I did not believe I had touched that man .
Against a diseased imagination , demonstration goes for nothing .
No -- you do n't mean it .
( Dumb-show sentimentalisms . )
All right , all right -- have it your own way , you quartette of swindlers !
I was spying out from under the shade of my hat brim , searching the floor for leather .
Before long I spied out the plug 's mate .
CHAPTER V. A TRAGEDY IN THE WOODS
`` Yes , I swear it . ''
BENNY she was looking pretty sober , and she sighed some , now and then ; but pretty soon she got to asking about Mary , and Sid , and Tom 's aunt Polly , and then Aunt Sally 's clouds cleared off and she got in a good humor and joined in on the questions and was her lovingest best self , and so the rest of the supper went along gay and pleasant .
But the old man he did n't take any hand hardly , and was absent-minded and restless , and done a considerable amount of sighing ; and it was kind of heart-breaking to see him so sad and troubled and worried .
We loafed along up the road , and now and then met a person and stopped and said howdy , and told them when we come , and how we left the folks at home , and how long we was going to stay , and all that , but none of them said a word about that thing ; which was just astonishing , and no mistake .
Tom said he believed if we went to the sycamores we would find that body laying there solitary and alone , and not a soul around .
Said he believed the men chased the thieves so far into the woods that the thieves prob'ly seen a good chance and turned on them at last , and maybe they all killed each other , and so there was n't anybody left to tell .
Poor Benny , she kept up the best she could , and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the house , but it kind of went for nothing , as you may say .
Tom and all of us kept telling him it WAS N'T murder , but just accidental killing !
He actu'ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man .
Why , that was awful , you know .
But he promised he would n't say a word about his murder when others was around , and we was glad of that .
On both sides of the canyon the mountains rise wall-like , three thousand feet , and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day , when he sails over at noon .
The tavern is the only `` frame '' house -- the only house , one might say .
It occupies a central position , and is the evening resort of the population .
`` All right ! ''
He's on the track of something . ''
`` Thank you , that is all .
I say , all for the present . ''
Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer , out of friendship , and helped him bury his late relative , the unlamented Buckner , and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer , Hillyer acting as chief .
It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope !
`` If the Frinch army survoives until Christmas there 'll be throuble .
Return to Constantinople -- We Sail for Asia -- The Sailors Burlesque the Imperial Visitors -- Ancient Smyrna -- The `` Oriental Splendor '' Fraud -- The `` Biblical Crown of Life '' -- Pilgrim Prophecy-Savans -- Sociable Armenian Girls -- A Sweet Reminiscence -- '' The Camels are Coming , Ha-ha ! ''
It was breezy and pleasant , but the sea was still very rough .
`` No , Jack ; it will be worth more than a thousand dollars -- when you get it done . ''
The mountains on some of the islands are very high .
`` Oh , that will do -- that 's enough .
Here is a bronzed Moor in a prodigious white turban , curiously embroidered jacket , gold and crimson sash , of many folds , wrapped round and round his waist , trousers that only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff in them , ornamented scimitar , bare shins , stockingless feet , yellow slippers , and gun of preposterous length -- a mere soldier !
Their noses are all hooked , and hooked alike .
They all resemble each other so much that one could almost believe they were of one family .
Their women are plump and pretty , and do smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degree comforting .
The Moors , like other savages , learn by what they see , not what they hear or read .
We have great fleets in the Mediterranean , but they seldom touch at African ports .
But the moment the Spanish minister makes a demand , it is acceded to at once , whether it be just or not .
No gas to read by -- nothing but dismal candles .
It was a shame .
But above all things , he has taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands and made it a tolerably free land -- for people who will not attempt to go too far in meddling with government affairs .
No country offers greater security to life and property than France , and one has all the freedom he wants , but no license -- no license to interfere with anybody or make anyone uncomfortable .
The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out , except that they smoked .
Nearby was a large , handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way , and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America .
I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter , about this sort of people , until I have read them up and know whether they are entitled to any tearful attentions or not .
We came near making a carom sometimes , but not the one we were trying to make .
We had to stop playing finally because Dan got to sleeping fifteen minutes between the counts and paying no attention to his marking .
Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to year permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen !
If a grandly gifted man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for bread rather than starve with the nobility that is in him untainted , the excuse is a valid one .
It would excuse theft in Washingtons and Wellingtons , and unchastity in women as well .
`` Upon the whole , last night 's performances shed honor not only upon the management but upon the city that encourages and sustains such wholesome and instructive entertainments .
We would simply suggest that the practice of vulgar young boys in the gallery of shying peanuts and paper pellets at the tigers , and saying `` Hi-yi ! ''
and manifesting approbation or dissatisfaction by such observations as `` Bully for the lion ! ''
`` Go it , Gladdy ! ''
`` Take a walk round the block ! ''
Several times last night , when the supernumeraries entered the arena to drag out the bodies , the young ruffians in the gallery shouted , `` Supe !
and also , `` Oh , what a coat ! ''
`` Born in Egypta .
Never heard of Egypta before .
How calm he is -- how self-possessed .
The city has a population of one hundred and thirty-three thousand , and is growing faster than any other small city out of America .
Its roadstead is full of ships .
Engineers are at work , now , turning the open roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor .
It is a lovely place .
The beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the park , the park sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills , and both look out upon the breezy ocean .
The `` dews of Hermon '' are falling upon us now , and the tents are almost soaked with them .
It is a pity some great ruin does not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles , and scare their kind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monuments again , forever .
The new horse is not much to boast of , I think .
Most of his teeth are gone , and he is as blind as bat .
I can not keep from talking about my horses , because I have a very long and tedious journey before me , and they naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently much greater importance .
Our pilgrims broke off specimens .
We visited , also , a new chapel , in the midst of the town , which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet thick ; the priests discovered , a few years ago , that the disciples had sat upon this rock to rest , once , when they had walked up from Capernaum .
Relics are very good property .
Our pilgrims would have liked very well to get out their lampblack and stencil-plates and paint their names on that rock , together with the names of the villages they hail from in America , but the priests permit nothing of that kind .
I suppose that by this time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch , and its weight to a ton ; and I do not hesitate to charge that they will go back there to-night and try to carry it off .
I said : `` She is not tall , she is short ; she is not beautiful , she is homely ; she is graceful enough , I grant , but she is rather boisterous . ''
I can not speak now of the Mount of Olives or its view of Jerusalem , the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab ; nor of the Damascus Gate or the tree that was planted by King Godfrey of Jerusalem .
One ought to feel pleasantly when he talks of these things .
I can not say any thing about the stone column that projects over Jehoshaphat from the Temple wall like a cannon , except that the Moslems believe Mahomet will sit astride of it when he comes to judge the world .
It is a pity he could not judge it from some roost of his own in Mecca , without trespassing on our holy ground .
Close by is the Golden Gate , in the Temple wall -- a gate that was an elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the Temple , and is even so yet .
The Moslems watch the Golden Gate with a jealous eye , and an anxious one , for they have an honored tradition that when it falls , Islamism will fall and with it the Ottoman Empire .
It did not grieve me any to notice that the old gate was getting a little shaky .
Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle .
My first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins .
So did all the others .
We all remarked that , afterwards .
I know that , because each man told what he would have done , individually ; and such a medley of strange and unheard-of inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of .
One man said he had calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood , if need be , but never yield an inch ; he was going to wait , with deadly patience , till he could count the stripes upon the first Bedouin 's jacket , and then count them and let him have it .
His orbs gleamed with a deadly light , but his lips moved not .
Anxiety grew , and he was questioned .
He smiled a smile of grim contempt and shook his head .
Would he have stabbed him ?
Would he have quartered him -- flayed him ?
At last Harry caught him .
Sea full of flying-fish .
The expedition was a success in some respects , in some it was not .
Originally it was advertised as a `` pleasure excursion . ''
Any body 's and every body 's notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous .
It may be supposed that the other fourth was composed of young girls .
most of them were even writing books .
They never romped , they talked but little , they never sang , save in the nightly prayer-meeting .
The pleasure ship was a synagogue , and the pleasure trip was a funeral excursion without a corpse .
( There is nothing exhilarating about a funeral excursion without a corpse . )
A free , hearty laugh was a sound that was not heard oftener than once in seven days about those decks or in those cabins , and when it was heard it met with precious little sympathy .
quadrilles , of a single set , made up of three ladies and five gentlemen , ( the latter with handkerchiefs around their arms to signify their sex . )
who timed their feet to the solemn wheezing of a melodeon ; but even this melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful , and dancing was discontinued .
The next man was also an Irishman .
I can not bring myself to change any line or word in Susy 's sketch of me , but will introduce passages from it now and then just as they came in their quaint simplicity out of her honest heart , which was the beautiful heart of a child .
What comes from that source has a charm and grace of its own which may transgress all the recognized laws of literature , if it choose , and yet be literature still , and worthy of hospitality .
I shall print the whole of this little biography , before I have done with it -- every word , every sentence .
Mark is a bachelor , faultless in taste , whose snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with Washington washerwomen ; but the heroism of Mark is settled for all time , for such purity and smoothness were never seen before .
His lavender gloves might have been stolen from some Turkish harem , so delicate were they in size ; but more likely -- anything else were more likely than that .
`` Sometimes by an assertion of the inter-State commerce power , sometimes by an assertion of the taxing power , the national government is taking up the performance of duties which under the changed conditions the separate States are no longer capable of adequately performing . ''
Simmons invited no more candidates to the platform .
In the beginning of the second week I conquered the last doubters .
I was as hurt by this as if I were engaged in some honest occupation .
That handful of overwise old gentlemen kept on shaking their heads all the first week , and saying they had seen no marvels there that could not have been produced by collusion ; and they were pretty vain of their unbelief , too , and liked to show it and air it , and be superior to the ignorant and the gullible .
Particularly old Dr. Peake , who was the ringleader of the irreconcilables , and very formidable ; for he was an F.F.V.
When I conquered him , at last , I knew I was undisputed master of the field ; and now , after more than fifty years , I acknowledge , with a few dry old tears , that I rejoiced without shame .
[ _Dictated March 28th , 1906._ ] About 1849 or 1850 Orion severed his connection with the printing-house in St. Louis and came up to Hannibal , and bought a weekly paper called the Hannibal `` Journal , '' together with its plant and its good-will , for the sum of five hundred dollars cash .
He reduced the rates for advertising in about the same proportion , and thus he created one absolute and unassailable certainty -- to wit : that the business would never pay him a single cent of profit .
He took me out of the `` Courier '' office and engaged my services in his own at three dollars and a half a week , which was an extravagant wage , but Orion was always generous , always liberal with everybody except himself .
He kept that paper alive during four years , but I have at this time no idea how he accomplished it .
Toward the end of each year he had to turn out and scrape and scratch for the fifty dollars of interest due Mr. Johnson , and that fifty dollars was about the only cash he ever received or paid out , I suppose , while he was proprietor of that newspaper , except for ink and printing-paper .
He was always falling in love with girls , but by some accident or other he had never gone so far as engagement before .
[ Sidenote : ( 1890 . )
Why , how could I talk when he was talking ?
He said , with the half-affronted air of a mathematician who has been asked how much of the multiplication table he can recite without a break :
It is a handsome instance of mental telegraphy -- or if it is n't that , it is a handsome case of coincidence .
Observe the ass , for instance : his character is about perfect , he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler animals , yet see what ridicule has brought him to .
Instead of feeling complimented when we are called an ass , we are left in doubt._ -- Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen ; and so I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction by a trained barrister -- if that is what they are called .
These chapters are right , now , in every detail , for they were rewritten under the immediate eye of William Hicks , who studied law part of a while in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over here to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni Vermicelli 's horse-feed shed , which is up the back alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto 's campanile and yet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school , at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was then , too , and this is not flattery , far from it .
He was a little rusty on his law , but he rubbed up for this book , and those two or three legal chapters are right and straight , now .
He told me so himself .
Given under my hand this second day of January , 1893 , at the Villa Viviani , village of Settignano , three miles back of Florence , on the hills -- the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found on this planet , and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to be found in any planet or even in any solar system -- and given , too , in the swell room of the house , with the busts of Cerretani senators and other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me , as they used to look down upon Dante , and mutely asking me to adopt them into my family , which I do with pleasure , for my remotest ancestors are but spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques , and it will be a great and satisfying lift for me , that six hundred years will .
CHAPTER 1 -- Pudd'nhead Wins His Name _Tell the truth or trump -- but get the trick._ -- Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson 's Landing , on the Missouri side of the Mississippi , half a day 's journey , per steamboat , below St. Louis .
A home without a cat -- and a well-fed , well-petted , and properly revered cat -- may be a perfect home , perhaps , but how can it prove title ?
It was six blocks long , and in each block two or three brick stores , three stories high , towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops .
The hamlet 's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river ; its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline ; its most rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about its base line of the hills ; the hills rose high , enclosing the town in a half-moon curve , clothed with forests from foot to summit .
Dawson 's Landing was a slaveholding town , with a rich , slave-worked grain and pork country back of it .
He was well off , and was gradually adding to his store .
The longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away , but the blessing never came -- and was never to come .
Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex , another F.F.V .
of formidable caliber -- however , with him we have no concern .
On the first of February , 1830 , two boy babes were born in his house ; one to him , one to one of his slave girls , Roxana by name .
Roxana was twenty years old .
She was up and around the same day , with her hands full , for she was tending both babes .
Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week .
He had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the State of New York , to seek his fortune .
But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village , and it `` gaged '' him .
`` Because I would kill my half . ''
One said : `` 'Pears to be a fool . ''
Mr. Driscoll missed another small sum of money -- which is a way of saying that this was not a new thing , but had happened before .
Theft he could not abide , and plainly there was a thief in his house .
Sharp measures must be taken .
`` Good morning , Mr. Higgins -- present you to Count Angelo Capello . ''
Handshake , admiring stare , `` Glad to see ye '' -- courteous nod , smily `` Most happy ! ''
`` Well , I 's gwine to tell you , if you gim me a chanst , Mammy .
`` Now , Roxy , do n't punish me any more .
Tell me -- I 'll give you the five dollars . ''
`` The whole thing is moonshine ; now then , go ahead and do your worst ; I 'm done with you . ''
Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi , who read it to himself and said to Tom :
`` Do n't mention it . ''
That was reason enough for a mother to love a child ; so she loved him , and told him so .
It made him wince , secretly -- for she was a `` nigger . ''
He had three hundred dollars left .
In one year this fund would buy her free again .
This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt , who realized now , `` as she had never done before , '' she said , what a sensitive and delicate nature her darling had , and how he adored his poor uncle .
Then for an instant , as we whistled by , the red glare from our furnaces would reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator as if under a lightning-flash , and in that instant our firemen and deck-hands would send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity , one of our wheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar , and down the dead blackness would shut again .
These people brought up their lantern , then , of course ; and as we backed and filled to get away , the precious family stood in the light of it -- both sexes and various ages -- and cursed us till everything turned blue .
Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through our pilot-house , when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very narrow place .
By the time the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before ; we were shaving stumpy shores , like that at the foot of Madrid Bend , which I had always seen avoided before ; we were clattering through chutes like that of 82 , where the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of timber till our nose was almost at the very spot .
The dense , untouched forest overhung both banks of the crooked little crack , and one could believe that human creatures had never intruded there before .
It was an easy plan to make , and would have been an easy one to follow , twenty years ago -- but not now .
There are wide intervals between boats , these days .
Near the mouth of the river several islands were missing -- washed away .
The Mississippi is a just and equitable river ; it never tumbles one man's farm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man's neighbor .
As we approached famous and formidable Plum Point , darkness fell , but that was nothing to shudder about -- in these modern times .
For now the national government has turned the Mississippi into a sort of two-thousand-mile torchlight procession .
In the head of every crossing , and in the foot of every crossing , the government has set up a clear-burning lamp .
One might almost say that lamps have been squandered there .
Dozens of crossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created , and have never been shoal since ; crossings so plain , too , and also so straight , that a steamboat can take herself through them without any help , after she has been through once .
The depredations of this extensive combination were severely felt ; but so well were their plans arranged , that although Murel , who was always active , was everywhere suspected , there was no proof to be obtained .
It so happened , however , that a young man of the name of Stewart , who was looking after two slaves which Murel had decoyed away , fell in with him and obtained his confidence , took the oath , and was admitted into the gang as one of the General Council .
The following are a few extracts : --
'Myself and a fellow by the name of Crenshaw gathered four good horses and started for Georgia .
We got in company with a young South Carolinian just before we got to Cumberland Mountain , and Crenshaw soon knew all about his business .
We concluded he was a prize .
Crenshaw had traveled the road before , but I never had ; we had traveled several miles on the mountain , when he passed near a great precipice ; just before we passed it Crenshaw asked me for my whip , which had a pound of lead in the butt ; I handed it to him , and he rode up by the side of the South Carolinian , and gave him a blow on the side of the head and tumbled him from his horse ; we lit from our horses and fingered his pockets ; we got twelve hundred and sixty-two dollars .
Crenshaw said he knew a place to hide him , and he gathered him under his arms , and I by his feet , and conveyed him to a deep crevice in the brow of the precipice , and tumbled him into it , and he went out of sight ; we then tumbled in his saddle , and took his horse with us , which was worth two hundred dollars .

This reminds me that a remark of a very peculiar nature was made here in my neighborhood ( in the North ) a few days ago : 'He had n't ought to have went . '
Is n't that a good deal of a triumph ?
To-day I heard a schoolmistress ask , 'Where is John gone ? '
This form is so common -- so nearly universal , in fact -- that if she had used 'whither' instead of 'where , ' I think it would have sounded like an affectation .
A lull permitted a start , and homewards we steamed , an inky sky overhead and a heavy wind blowing .
And there was no such person .
That did no sort of good .
The distant relatives flocked in and exposed the fraudful date with extreme suddenness and surprising ease , and carried off the fortune , leaving the Johnsons very legitimately , and legally , and irrevocably chained together in honorable marriage , but with not so much as a penny to bless themselves withal .

The locomotive is in sight from the deck of the steamboat almost the whole way from St. Louis to St. Paul -- eight hundred miles .
In that day the influx of population was so great , and the freight business so heavy , that the boats were not able to keep up with the demands made upon their carrying capacity ; consequently the captains were very independent and airy -- pretty 'biggity , ' as Uncle Remus would say .
The clerk nut-shelled the contrast between the former time and the present , thus --

The washing down of the decks begins at a very early hour in all ships ; in but few ships are any measures taken to protect the passengers , either by waking or warning them , or by sending a steward to close their ports .

It does after a fashion suggest a cross -- a cross that is out of repair -- or out of drawing ; not correctly shaped .

With a country as big as the United States to live and multiply in , and with no epidemic diseases among them till the white man came with those and his other appliances of civilization , it is quite probable that there was never a day in his history when he could muster 100,000 of his race in all Australia .
He did not need to practise these artificialities any more after the white man came .
The white man knew ways of reducing a native population 80 percent .

When they had , in the depth of winter , to cross deep and rapid rivers , pass among mountains six thousand feet high , pierce dangerous thickets , and find food in a country forsaken even by birds , we can realize their hardships .
However , Robertson 's own generation honored him , and in manifesting it honored themselves .
The Government gave him a money-reward and a thousand acres of land ; and the people held mass-meetings and praised him and emphasized their praise with a large subscription of money .
At that time Memphis had a wharf boat , of course .
There was a paved sloping wharf , for the accommodation of freight , but the steamers landed on the outside of the wharfboat , and all loading and unloading was done across it , between steamer and shore .
A number of wharfboat clerks were needed , and part of the time , every day , they were very busy , and part of the time tediously idle .

In one of these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said , `` In Thuggee this is strictly forbidden , and is an act from which no good can come .
I was ill of a fever for ten days afterward .
If there be no cow it does not signify . ''
Another Thug said he held the cowherd 's feet while this witness did the strangling .
He felt no concern , `` because the bad fortune of such a deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants ; even if there should be a hundred of them . ''

We woke him next morning before dawn and set out , and at the distance of three miles we seated him to rest while it was still very dark .
Benares was not a disappointment .
It justified its reputation as a curiosity .

The sacred cow swarms along , too , and goes whither she pleases , and takes toll of the grain-shops , and is very much in the way , and is a good deal of a nuisance , since she must not be molested .
In the same way , with one year's Indian statistics before you , you can guess closely at how many people were killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year , and the year before that , and the year before that , and at how many were killed in each of those years by bears , how many by wolves , and how many by snakes ; and you can also guess closely at how many people are going to be killed each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies .
Fifty Indians and Chinamen asleep in a big tent in the waist of the ship forward ; they lie side by side with no space between ; the former wrapped up , head and all , as in the Indian streets , the Chinamen uncovered ; the lamp and things for opium smoking in the center .

It said that the house that Shakespeare was born in at Stratford-on-Avon was falling gradually to ruin through neglect ; that the room where the poet first saw the light was now serving as a butcher 's shop ; that all appeals to England to contribute money ( the requisite sum stated ) to buy and repair the house and place it in the care of salaried and trustworthy keepers had fallen resultless .
He had carried his copy of the letter along , and if his instructions required him -- in case of emergency -- to see that it fell into the hands of the Boers , he loyally carried them out .
As a military man , I wish to point out what seems to me to be military errors in the conduct of the campaign which we have just been considering .
I served two weeks in the beginning of our Civil War , and during all that time commanded a battery of infantry composed of twelve men .
I tired out and disqualified many battalions , yet never had a casualty myself nor lost a man .

The gossips of the city got hold of it .
The following is his speech as reported in the London Observer :
Takes his leave with a bow and a scrape fit to honor majesty withal !
Desires a continuance of my custom !
If there is any one particular old scrap that you are more down on than any other , and which you are gradually wearing your life out trying to get rid of , you may take all the pains you possibly can in that direction , but it wo n't be of any use , because they will always fetch that old scrap back and put it in the same old place again every time .
She felt that the field of her affections was growing more and more circumscribed every day , but once more she frowned down her relatives and renewed her betrothal .
My first impulse was to get him removed .
However , that would harm others besides himself , and do me no real good , and so I let him stay .

`` There were remarkable things about the stranger called the Man -- Mystery-things so very extraordinary that they monopolized attention and made all of him seem extraordinary ; but this was not so , the most of his qualities being of the common , every-day size and like anybody else 's .

This veto power could some time or other have a large value for her , therefore she was wise to reserve it .
If the Clerk of this Church shall receive a communication from the Pastor Emeritus which he does not fully understand , he shall inform her of this fact before presenting it to the Church , and obtain a clear understanding of the matter -- then act in accordance therewith . ''
But the branch Church can not select the lecturer .
Mrs. Eddy does it .
It did not belong in that list ; it was a force that was not a detail of her character , but was an outside one .
The object of it does not need to coddle it , bribe it , beguile it , reason with it , convince it -- it commands it ; that is sufficient ; the obedience rendered is not reluctant , but prompt and whole-hearted .
Admiration for a Napoleon , confidence in him , pride in him , affection for him , can lift him high and carry him far ; and these are forms of worship , and are strong forces , but they are worship of a mere human being , after all , and are infinitely feeble , as compared with those that are generated by that other worship , the worship of a divine personage .
For the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful : the power , through loving mercifulness and compassion , to heal fleshly ills and pains and grief -- all -- with a word , with a touch of the hand !
This power was given by the Saviour to the Disciples , and to all the converted .
These things are true , or they are not .
The Branch Church 's pulpit is occupied by two `` Readers . ''
The authority of the other sovereigns has limits , hers has none , none whatever .
The sentiment which they feel for her is one which goes out in sheer perfection to no other occupant of a throne ; for it is love , pure from doubt , envy , exaction , fault-seeking , a love whose sun has no spot -- that form of love , strong , great , uplifting , limitless , whose vast proportions are compassable by no word but one , the prodigious word , Worship .
And it is not as a human being that her subjects worship her , but as a supernatural one , a divine one , one who has comradeship with God , and speaks by His voice .
`` Why , ma , I had n't any difficulty .

She dreaded the answer ; and her instinct was right .
She was deeply religious , and this is a thing which sometimes gives a melancholy cast to a person 's countenance , but it was not so in her case .
Her religion made her inwardly content and joyous ; and if she was troubled at times , and showed the pain of it in her face and bearing , it came of distress for her country ; no part of it was chargeable to her religion .

From his house I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs , and wait and strive until my prayer is granted .
This gave the growing interest a new and powerful impulse ; the excitement rose higher and higher , and hope and faith along with it ; and so from Vaucouleurs wave after wave of this inspiring enthusiasm flowed out over the land , far and wide , invading all the villages and refreshing and revivifying the perishing children of France ; and from these villages came people who wanted to see for themselves , hear for themselves ; and they did see and hear , and believe .
They filled the town ; they more than filled it ; inns and lodgings were packed , and yet half of the inflow had to go without shelter .
She answered him in her tranquil , serious way :
You could see the response in that nobleman 's face ; you could see his eye light up ; there was sympathy there .
He said , most earnestly :

Some folks think the nigger ai n't far from here .
I 'm one of them -- but I hai n't talked it around .
A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson 's Island .
Do n't anybody live there ?
I did n't say any more , but I done some thinking .
and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and I says :
Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so WE saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he WAS the best cretur !
`` Dah she is ? ''
`` Do you belong on it ? ''
They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get STARTED right when he's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat .
Towards daybreak we tied up , and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good .
Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit rafting .
We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how .
You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . ''
Oh , no , I reckon not !
I hai n't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door ; no , I hai n't ever seen her since , but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever I 'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER , blamed if I would n't a done it or bust .
I went on a-whimpering , and says :
And I think he died afterwards .
He turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection .
They say he was a sight to look at .
Your uncle 's been up to the town every day to fetch you .

And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us .
So she did n't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left .
Well , it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon .
It shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time . ''
`` Oh , I do n't know .

We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet's nest , but we did n't .
The family was at home .
And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ?
-- oh , no , I reckon not !
And there war n't a blessed snake up there when we went back -- we did n't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left .
So we judged we could get some of them again .
No , there war n't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell .
You 'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you did n't want them .
You could n't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs .
But Tom said all women was just so .
He said they was made that way for some reason or other .
Fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun .
I was most powerful sick , and slunk to a chair and set down .
`` Who is your folks ? ''
They cussed Jim considerble , though , and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while , but Jim never said nothing , and he never let on to know me , and they took him to the same cabin , and put his own clothes on him , and chained him again , and not to no bed-leg this time , but to a big staple drove into the bottom log , and chained his hands , too , and both legs , and said he war n't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come , or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time , and filled up our hole , and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night , and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing , and then the old doctor comes and takes a look , and says :
We had Jim out of the chains in no time , and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do .
If that timid man had lived all his life in a community of human rabbits , had never read of brave deeds , had never heard speak of them , had never heard any one praise them nor express envy of the heroes that had done them , he would have had no more idea of bravery than Adam had of modesty , and it could never by any possibility have occurred to him to RESOLVE to become brave .
And so , when he heard bravery extolled and cowardice derided , it woke him up .
They wear diverse clothes and are subject to diverse moods , but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the SAME PERSON all the time .
To change the figure , the COMPULSION that moves a man -- and there is but the one -- is the necessity of securing the contentment of his own spirit .
-- in fact , fascinating is the word .
Then if he happen by the accidents of life to be evilly placed there is no help for him , according to your notions -- he must train downward .
Having found the Truth ; perceiving that beyond question man has but one moving impulse -- the contenting of his own spirit -- and is merely a machine and entitled to no personal merit for anything he does , it is not humanly possible for me to seek further .
During months I dreamed that dream , and tried to contrive ways to get to Para and spring that splendid enterprise upon an unsuspecting planet .
But all in vain .
This was another turning-point , another link .
I have been punished many and many a time , and bitterly , for doing things and reflecting afterward , but these tortures have been of no value to me ; I still do the thing commanded by Circumstance and Temperament , and reflect afterward .
When I am reflecting , on those occasions , even deaf persons can hear me think .
They were envied by all the other young fellows now .

And it is the only witness with a human face that was there to see the marvel , and remains to us a memorial of it .
I am not a musical critic , and did not come here to write essays about the operas and deliver judgment upon their merits .
What I write about the performance to put in my odd time would be offered to the public as merely a cat 's view of a king , and not of didactic value .
By consequence they are larger and longer and sleeker than their working sisters .
And they have a curved sting , shaped like a scimitar , while the others have a straight one .
Ben Jonson says of Bacon , as orator :
Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace person -- a manager , an actor of inferior grade , a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence , and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave .

So he put his type-girl to work , and we timed her by the watch .
We timed the girl over and over again -- with the same result always : she won out .

This was a remarkable boy in many ways .
At four or five in the afternoon the mercury began to go down , and then it became necessary to change to thick garments .
I went to St. George's in the morning clothed in the thinnest of linen , and reached home at five in the afternoon with two overcoats on .

Most of the students were Germans , of course , but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous .

The latter visited her and persecuted her with their supplications , but without effect , for her heart was true to her poor despised Crusader , who was fighting in the Holy Land .
Finally , she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the rich lovers no longer ; so one stormy night she escaped and went down the river and hid herself in the cave on the other side .
As the days went by , and still no tidings of her came , his conscience began to torture him , and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet living and would return , he would oppose her no longer , she might marry whom she would .
`` Once I saw thee in dark night , In supernatural Beauty bright ; Of Light-rays , was the Figure wove , To share its light , locked-hair strove .
That I am so sorrowful ?
`` Let her go off a point ! ''
It has been said that for ages Dilsberg has been merely a thriving and diligent idiot-factory .
I had but one misfortune with my things .
It was a great pity .
We spent a day or two in farewell visits , and then left for Baden-Baden .
The only trouble was that the trip was too short .
We came into town on foot .
A good many of these people are there for a real purpose , however ; they are racked with rheumatism , and they are there to stew it out in the hot baths .
Perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with medicinal springs as Germany .
Some of these baths are good for one ailment , some for another ; and again , peculiar ailments are conquered by combining the individual virtues of several different baths .
That is not a dose to be forgotten right away .
`` What is your own religion ? ''
`` That dead child 's name .
`` She did n't do anything in particular .
She told me her name . ''
We did not buy any wooden images of the Lion , nor any ivory or ebony or marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones , or even any photographic slanders of him .
`` You could n't stay ... a day ... well , say two days longer ? ''
Riley stood silent , apparently deep in a reverie , during a minute or more , then he looked up and said :
`` On the 9th of April he sold the saddle -- said he was n't going to risk HIS life with any perishable saddle-girth that ever was made , over a rainy , miry April road , while he could ride bareback and know and feel he was safe -- always HAD despised to ride on a saddle , anyway .
`` Good gracious , do you speak Arabic ? ''
An American village at ten o'clock on a summer Sunday is the quietest and peacefulest and holiest thing in nature ; but it is a pretty different thing half an hour later .
Mr. Poe 's poem of the `` Bells '' stands incomplete to this day ; but it is well enough that it is so , for the public reciter or `` reader '' who goes around trying to imitate the sounds of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself `` up a stump '' when he got to the church-bell -- as Joseph Addison would say .
The church is always trying to get other people to reform ; it might not be a bad idea to reform itself a little , by way of example .
It is still clinging to one or two things which were useful once , but which are not useful now , neither are they ornamental .
The clergyman even reads the hymn through -- a relic of an ancient time when hymn-books are scarce and costly ; but everybody has a hymn-book , now , and so the public reading is no longer necessary .
Its office , henceforth , for all time , will be to keep watch and ward over the secret resting-place of the young Lord Douglas , who , in 1865 , was precipitated from the summit over a precipice four thousand feet high , and never seen again .
I was in the very first act of detailing an Expedition to succor him , when the cord was assailed with a series of such frantic jerks that I could hardly keep hold of it .
The huzza that went up , then , was good to hear .
The estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sea-level is pretty correct -- for Baedeker .
About 6 P.M. , we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward Zermatt , and all peril was over .
Such is Mr. Whymper 's graphic and thrilling narrative .
Zermatt gossip darkly hints that the elder Taugwalder cut the rope , when the accident occurred , in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the abyss ; but Mr. Whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence of cutting , but only of breaking .

Her successor visited Chamonix later , but in far different style .
They are terribly anxious for the villain to get his bullet , and that I take to be a humane and proper sentiment .
It comes out of the candy money , and the money that goes for chewing-gum and other necessaries of life .
Is there a college in the whole country where there is a chair of good citizenship ?
There are some which teach insane citizenship , bastard citizenship , but that is all .
He must be rescued from the law and consecrated to diplomacy .
Washington and his anecdote have done that .
Now then , let us look at this mighty question reasonably , rationally , sanely -- yes , and calmly , not excitedly .
I think she never saw a spelling-book in her life .
It reduces the fonetics to the last gasp -- it squeezes the surplusage out of every word -- there 's no spelling that can begin with it on this planet outside of the White House .
And as for the punctuation , there is n't any .
The letter is absolutely genuine -- I have the proofs of that in my possession .
I came into the drawing-room , where Mrs. Winton was sitting up very stiff in a chair , beating me at my own game .
There was a subject that interested him all the time .
I can not call him a doctor , for he has not the authority to give a certificate if a patient should die , but fortunately they do n't .
Things went on very pleasantly .
Then this friend said to me : `` Now , I will tell you about that .
When you appeal to my head , I do n't feel it ; but when you appeal to my heart , I do feel it .
I was very careful and pawed along that shelf , and there was a pitcher of water about a foot high , and it was at the head of Twichell 's bed , but I did n't know it .
You needed a telescope to find it .
He invents too many new ideas .
No , I do n't want anything to do with a horse .
What I prize most is safety , and in , the second place swift transit and handiness .
These are best furnished , by the American line , whose watertight compartments have no passage through them ; no doors to be left open , and consequently no way for water to get from one of them to another in time of collision .
I suppose I must say `` Good-bye . ''
Then came in a sweet little middle-aged man , who at once began looking around the lobby .
`` Now , '' said I , `` what discount do you allow to the clergy ? ''
But I hold that it was an innocent , unconscious act , due , perhaps , to heredity .
He was thinking about ecclesiastical matters , and when a man is in that condition of mind he will take anybody 's hat .
Of course , he was hard at it .
She could have kept her word .
About this there was no doubt .
`` Had you other occupations at home ? ''
`` I believe wholly -- as wholly as I believe the Christian faith and that God has redeemed us from the fires of hell , that God speaks to me by that Voice ! ''
Poor Joan was grown dreamy and absent ; possibly she was tired .
Her life was in imminent danger , and she did not suspect it .
At the time that she wanted to take Paris and could have done it with ease if our King had but consented , she said that that was the golden time ; that , with Paris ours , all France would be ours in six months .
Our reading of the prophecy was this : We believed the King 's soul was going to be smitten with remorse ; and that he would privately plan a rescue with Joan 's old lieutenants , D'Alencon and the Bastard and La Hire , and that this rescue would take place at the end of the three months .
So we made up our minds to be ready and take a hand in it .
It was plain , from chance words which one caught now and then , that Cauchon and Loyseleur were insisting upon the application of the torture , and that most of the others were urgently objecting .
And I could read as by print , in their marveling countenances , the words that were drifting through their minds : `` Can it be true , is it believable , that it is this little creature , this girl , this child with the good face , the sweet face , the beautiful face , the dear and bonny face , that has carried fortresses by storm , charged at the head of victorious armies , blown the might of England out of her path with a breath , and fought a long campaign , solitary and alone , against the massed brains and learning of France -- and had won it if the fight had been fair ! ''
She glanced up , at those awful words , and for the first time she saw the stake and the mass of red coals -- redder and angrier than ever now under the constantly deepening storm-gloom .
All the afternoon and evening of Tuesday , the 29th , the news was flying , and the people of the country-side flocking to Rouen to see the tragedy -- all , at least , who could prove their English sympathies and count upon admission .
Then a cloud slid over the moon , and I 'most cried , I was so glad .
which I thought it WAS .
We was all in a powerful excitement now , and grabbed the glasses and hunted everywheres for London , but could n't find hair nor hide of it , nor any other settlement -- nor any sign of a lake or a river , either .
We was close down now , and just blistering !
`` Yassir , if you give him time . ''
We kept the glasses gliding around all the time , till our arms got so tired we could n't hold them any more .
Dear , dear , a body do n't know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he ai n't ever going to come to any water any more .
At last I could n't stand it to look around on them baking plains ; I laid down on the locker , and give it up .
How does it prove it ? ''
`` Den how come He make a desert ? ''
It was a rattler , that caravan , and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession .
It was the gayest outfit you ever see , for rich clothes and nobby style .
Then a little faint breeze struck us , and then it come harder , and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire , and Tom sung out :
And moreover , besides , the thing they always said about them seemed to me to be stretchers .
If it had n't been in Sunday-school , I would 'a ' judged it was a lie ; and outside I was certain of it .
`` Looky here , it can be done , sure ; and I 'll tell you how .
Then you can follow the river north nearly , an hour and three quarters , till you see the Ohio come in ; then you want to look sharp , because you 're getting near .
I introduced Satan -- that is , Philip Traum -- and we sat down and talked .
There was no constraint .
The water came into her eyes .
He said he had never known his mamma ; she passed away while he was a young thing ; and said his papa was in shattered health , and had no property to speak of -- in fact , none of any earthly value -- but he had an uncle in business down in the tropics , and he was very well off and had a monopoly , and it was from this uncle that he drew his support .
The very mention of a kind uncle was enough to remind Marget of her own , and her eyes filled again .
When it was dark Marget took food and wine and fruit , in a basket , and hurried away to the jail , and Satan and I walked toward my home .
We remembered it , but had n't understood what he wanted .
But she was curious to know more about Philip Traum , and hoped I would bring him again .
It made the boys laugh , for I had told them the nonsense Satan had been stuffing her with .
Presently the thing happened which we were dreading .
A subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his , bringing with it a vague , dim , but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words might be true -- even must be true .
