The kangaroo still continues to grow , which is very strange and perplexing .
But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in , thinking that this one , being lonesome , would rather have that for company than have no kin at all , or any animal it could feel a nearness to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers who do not know its ways or habits , or what to do to make it feel that it is among friends ; but it was a mistake -- it went into such fits at the sight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one before .
I wanted to let it go , but she would n't hear of it .
That seemed cruel and not like her ; and yet she may be right .
For instance , Art is allowed as much indecent license to-day as in earlier times -- but the privileges of Literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years .
But the comical thing about it all , is , that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid marble , which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty , whereas warm-blooded paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it .

Wherever he appeared throngs turned out to bid him welcome .
He was lodging in a mechanics ' cheap boarding-house in Duane Street , and we may imagine the bareness of his room , the feeble poverty of his lamp .

Of course I have had no time , in 24 hours , to do anything .
Therefore I 'll answer after we are under way again .

He said that was true enough , but they would hang to it until it did prove rich .
MY DEAR SISTER , -I mailed a letter to you and Ma this morning , but since then I have received yours to Orion and me .
But it is singular , is n't it , that such a matter should interest Orion , when it is of no earthly consequence to me ?
He hunted me up as soon as he came here , and has done me a hundred favors since , and says if I will come to China in the first trip of the great mail steamer next January and make his house in Pekin my home , he will afford me facilities that few men can have there for seeing and learning .
He will give me letters to the chiefs of the great Mail Steamship Company which will be of service to me in this matter .
I expect to do all this , but I expect to go to the States first -- and from China to the Paris World's Fair .
They were set in fine nonpareil type , for one thing , which present-day eyes simply refuse at any price , and the reward , by present-day standards , is not especially tempting .
They want to send me abroad , as a Consul or a Minister .
I worry a great deal about being obliged to go without seeing you all , but it could not be helped .
`` I always like , '' wrote Holmes , `` to hear what one of my fellow countrymen , who is not a Hebrew scholar , or a reader of hiero-glyphics , but a good-humored traveler with a pair of sharp , twinkling Yankee ( in the broader sense ) eyes in his head , has to say about the things that learned travelers often make unintelligible , and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd ... .
A wish that was realized in due time , though it is doubtful if Doctor Holmes or any one else at the moment believed that a book of that nature and price ( it was $ 3.50 a copy ) would ever reach such a sale .
I had my life insured for $ 10,000 yesterday ( what ever became of Mr. Moffett ' s life insurance ? )
Tell Orion to keep a stiff upper lip -- when the worst comes to the worst I will come forward .
Must talk in Providence , R. I. , tonight .
I thank Mollie and Orion and the rest for your letters , but you see how I am pushed -- ought to have 6 clerks .
He never left Jackass Hill .
He struck a pocket years ago containing enough not only to build himself a comfortable house near his old cabin , but to last him , without work , to his painless end .
He was a Mason , and was buried by the Order in Sonora .
In a letter home , to his mother and sister , we get a further picture of his enjoyment .
`` O soul , soul , soul of mine : Soul , soul , soul of thine !
I could wind up with No .
I would rather sink a steamboat than eat , any time .
Now say you will .
Show him the canvassing specimens and beseech him to subscribe .
Pretty strong language -- for her .
I shall read that biography , though the letter of acceptance was amply sufficient to corral my vote without any further knowledge of the man .
The play entertained me hugely , even in its present crude state .
Howells 's biography of Hayes , meanwhile , had not gone well .
He reported that only two thousand copies had been sold in what was now the height of the campaign .
Immoral , I suppose .
Such books sell best , Howells says .
Nobody could do anything that night , or sleep , either ; but there was a deal of moving talk , with long pauses between pictures of that flying carriage , these pauses represented -- this picture intruded itself all the time and disjointed the talk .
I suppose we are located here for the winter .
Susie often translates Livy 's orders to the servants .
Now what is it ?
Well , time and time again it has seemed to me that I must drop everything and flee to Switzerland once more .
We must go again , Joe.
He had been invited to respond to the toast of `` The Ladies , '' but had replied that he had already responded to that toast more than once .
There was one class of the community , he said , commonly overlooked on these occasions -- the babies -- he would respond to that toast .
In his letter to Howells he had not been willing to speak freely of his personal triumph , but to Mrs. Clemens he must tell it all , and with that child-like ingenuousness which never failed him to his last day .
Suffice it you to know , scoffer and ribald , that the little child is old and blind , now , and once more toothless ; and the rest of us are shadows , these many , many years .
Yes , and your time cometh !
, -- Bliss is dead .
It reveals the fact , through my present contract , ( which is for half the profits on the book above actual cost of paper , printing and binding , ) that I have lost considerably by all this nonsense -- sixty thousand dollars , I should say -- and if Bliss were alive I would stay with the concern and get it all back ; for on each new book I would require a portion of that back pay ; but as it is ( this in the very strictest confidence , ) I shall probably go to a new publisher 6 or 8 months hence , for I am afraid Frank , with his poor health , will lack push and drive .
And when I get fagged out , I lie abed a couple of days and read and smoke , and then go it again for 6 or 7 days .
And I shall like it , whether anybody else does or not .
There had been some delay and postponement in the matter of the play which Howells and Clemens agreed to write .
In the end it became a revival of Colonel Sellers , or rather a caricature of that gentle hearted old visionary .
Clemens had always complained that the actor Raymond had never brought out the finer shades of Colonel Sellers 's character , but Raymond in his worst performance never belied his original as did Howells and Clemens in his dramatic revival .
I got nervous and came down to help hump-up the binderies ; and I mean to stay here pretty much all the time till the first days of March , when the second volume will issue .
And do n't write me any more damned rot about `` storms , '' and inability to pay trivial sums of money and -- and -- hell and damnation !
Livy is progressing admirably .
Hall , in New York :
Three days after the foregoing letter was written he wrote , briefly :
To Mrs. Clemens , in Paris :
Land , but it made my pulses leap , to think I was going to see you again !
I did hate to burden his good heart and over-worked head with it , but he took hold with avidity and said it was no burden to work for his friends , but a pleasure .
This letter , then , will contain cheque for the $ 100 which you have paid .
Nobody knows my address .
And the other night we had a detachment of the jubilee Singers -- 6 .
DEAR JOE , -- Just a word , to scoff at you , with your extravagant suggestion that I read the biography of Phillips Brooks -- the very dullest book that has been printed for a century .
She is discharging a trial-cook today and hiring another .
If she could speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word , and our perplexities would vanish away .

On another occasion , when Bynner had written a poem to Clara Clemens , her father pretended great indignation that the first poem written by Bynner to any one in his household should not be to him , and threatened revenge .
He read the lines that follow :
How do you suppose they feel when you come around -- looking the way you look ?
And you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural ?

`` Well , but -- why , Colonel , it 's six stories high .
`` As it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears .
I will explain what I mean .
Take a truer standard : the measure of a man 's contributing capacity to his time and his people -- the work he can do -- and then number the population of this country to-day , as multiplied by what a man can now do , more than his grandfather could do .
By way of rude but striking illustration , let us consider , for argument 's sake , that four of these millions consisted of aged people , little children , and other incapables , and that the remaining 13,000,000 were divided and employed as follows :
The process was not very difficult this time , for the man's smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning .
Tracy would even have liked him on the spot , but for the fact -- fact which he was not really aware of -- that the equality of men was not yet a reality to him , it was only a theory ; the mind perceived , but the man failed to feel it .
Lately I 'm not as strong as I was . ''
`` Do n't , Mr. Tracy , please . ''
She turned to her husband and said , `` Do bridle your tongue .
What has he done to be treated so ?
Ca n't you see he has lost his mind , with trouble and distress ?
`` You seem to prefer pinks .
About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist , and invited him to stay to dinner .
Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces ; and he felt that now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen , and hear her voice and watch her face during several precious hours , earth had nothing valuable to add to his life for the present .
He was proud of Gwendolen , and liked to show her off , even against Miss Belle Thompson , and here had been a great opportunity , and what had she made of it ?
He made up his mind that for the honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the social board before long .
I never saw the like -- and yet looking as beautiful as Satan , too -- and could n't seem to do anything but paw bread crumbs , and pick flowers to pieces , and look fidgety .
He is a person of stupendous character -- absolutely gigantic .
Under that placid exterior is concealed the most dare-devil spirit that was ever put into a man -- he 's just a Clive over again .
So he set his teeth and went at the matter with determination , but purposing to spare the girl one pain -- that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal .
`` His -- er -- his initials are S. M . ''
He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention , Snodgrass , there .
The news was told him that the English Rossmore was come .
In Syria , once , at the head-waters of the Jordan , a camel took charge of my overcoat while the tents were being pitched , and examined it with a critical eye , all over , with as much interest as if he had an idea of getting one made like it ; and then , after he was done figuring on it as an article of apparel , he began to contemplate it as an article of diet .
He put his foot on it , and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth , and chewed and chewed at it , gradually taking it in , and all the while opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy , as if he had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before , in his life .
Then he smacked his lips once or twice , and reached after the other sleeve .
The tails went next , along with some percussion caps and cough candy , and some fig-paste from Constantinople .
He began to gag and gasp , and his eyes to stand out , and his forelegs to spread , and in about a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenter 's work-bench , and died a death of indescribable agony .
`` You may depend upon it , we all did justice to the good things , and as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug , whilst we sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour , agreed it was the fastest living we had ever experienced .

We crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery and massacre of 1856 , wherein the driver and conductor perished , and also all the passengers but one , it was supposed ; but this must have been a mistake , for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I was personally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who were wounded during that massacre , and barely escaped with their lives .
There was no doubt of the truth of it -- I had it from their own lips .
The bullet that made it wounded the driver slightly , but he did not mind it much .
He said the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there , and that he came as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance , because they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he `` could n't hold his vittles . ''
For some time previously , the company 's horses had been frequently stolen , and the coaches delayed , by gangs of outlaws , who were wont to laugh at the idea of any man 's having the temerity to resent such outrages .
He repeatedly exclaimed , `` My God !
In a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws of glittering snow clasping them ; and with here and there , in the shade , down the mountain side , a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger than a lady 's pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a `` public square .

This is the account of the gathering and the battle :
`` Gentlemen , I know not who you are , but you have saved my life ; and although I can never be able to repay you for it , I feel that I can at least make one hour of your long journey lighter .

It was his daily habit to try experiments that had always before been considered impossible , but he always got through .

Whether to venture toward the mainland or not , was a question of some moment .
But we were so distressed by thirst that we decide to try it , and so Higbie fell to work and I took the steering-oar .
We would have gone back , now , but we did not dare to turn the boat around , because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would upset , of course .
Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas .
Now and then one of Higbie 's oars would trip on the top of a wave , and the other one would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus .
We were drenched by the sprays constantly , and the boat occasionally shipped water .
But I told him this was impossible ; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed , the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea , capsize , and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest .
It was my week to cook .
I always hated cooking -- now , I abhorred it .
After a moment the driver said he could not make change .

She wrote the opening chapter , and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity .
Mr. D. , a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies , followed Mr. F. , the third week , introducing a mysterious Roscicrucian who transmuted metals , held consultations with the devil in a cave at dead of night , and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines in such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers and breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel .
The Chinese have built their portion of the city to suit themselves ; and as they keep neither carriages nor wagons , their streets are not wide enough , as a general thing , to admit of the passage of vehicles .

Poi is the chief article of food among the natives , and is prepared from the taro plant .
And there is the `` royal family '' -- the customary hive of royal brothers , sisters , cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy , -- all with a spoon in the national pap-dish , and all bearing such titles as his or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-so .
Few of them can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages , however ; they sport the economical Kanaka horse or `` hoof it '' with the plebeians .
He was dressed entirely in black -- dress-coat and silk hat -- and looked rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him .

Finally he entered his carriage and drove away , and the populace shortly began to drop into his wake .
The first night , as I lay in my coffin , idly watching the dim lamp swinging to the rolling of the ship , and snuffing the nauseous odors of bilge water , I felt something gallop over me .
I turned out promptly .
However , I turned in again when I found it was only a rat .
I got up and put my clothes on and went on deck .
They saw him eat from the same vessel with them , and were appalled !
We walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width ; a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable degree of engineering skill .
In either case , however , as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest .

When we had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes , like a couple of idiots , with our hands aloft , freezing to death by inches , Mike 's interest in the joke began to wane .

A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark , just toned it down enough to make it dismal .

The havoc continued an hour and a half , and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials .
She called her guards and torches , and we went down into the dungeons .
In one of them was a woman , in foul rags , who sat on the ground , and would not answer a question or speak a word , but only looked up at us once or twice , through a cobweb of tangled hair , as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life ; after that , she sat bowed , with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap , and gave no further sign .
She was a commoner , and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite , a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was , and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur , and , moreover , had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood .
All the first years , their only question had been -- asked with beseechings and tears that might have moved stones , in time , perhaps , but hearts are not stones : `` Is he alive ? ''
One whole duke and six dukelets ; why , Sandy , it was an elegant haul .
Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade , and it is tedious hard work , too , but I begin to see that there _is_ money in it , after all , if you have luck .
A successful whirl in the knight-errantry line -- now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts ?
`` No , it 's not your head , Sandy .
And speaking of the cowboys , what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old .
Now there 's Morgan le Fay , as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet , to all appearances , and here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life , after raising such a family as he has raised .

`` I also am ready ; I will go with thee . ''
`` By the mass ye may not question it !

Then ye may not do better , good folk , than gather and hear the tale I have to tell , sith it concerneth you , forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find , and seek that ye will seek in vain , my life being hostage for my word , and my word and message being these , namely : That a hap has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years , which was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes thereunto contributing , wherein the matter -- ''
One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip , and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley , when I came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice , and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity .
I knew he had lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara , where lions and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and difficult , and had gone to Africa to take possession , so I thought I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation .
`` We had none , worshipful sir , the line failing before it had reached so far back . ''
`` There -- ye 're confessing it again , ye 're confessing it again ! ''
`` Well , then , suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him -- and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community , for his pride , or his prosperity , or one thing or another -- stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently , do n't they ? ''
And as he stood apart there , receiving this homage in rags , I thought to myself , well , really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king , after all .
There exists none other but that one .
The king sent the queen to the stake , proposing to purify her with fire .
Launcelot and his knights rescued her , and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine -- in fact , some of the best we ever had ; to wit , Sir Belias le Orgulous , Sir Segwarides , Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu , Sir Brandiles , Sir Aglovale -- ''
No life was in sight , but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks , who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke ; there would be sickness among the others -- there always is , after an episode like that .
So I felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small ; that is , of knights .
It was nightfall now , and I withdrew my pickets .
The one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight , but visible with the glass only .
They were feeling us , you see ; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again .
I placed the brook-connection under the guard and authority of three of my best boys , who would alternate in two-hour watches all night and promptly obey my signal , if I should have occasion to give it -- three revolver-shots in quick succession .
We had brief intervals of grim stillness , interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad ; and this sort of thing was going on , right along , and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness .
Why do n't you tell me , Mary ?
There was a rustling of dresses , and the standing congregation sat down .
He was restive all through it ; he kept tally of the details of the prayer , unconsciously -- for he was not listening , but he knew the ground of old , and the clergyman 's regular route over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded , his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it ; he considered additions unfair , and scoundrelly .
But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward ; and the instant the `` Amen '' was out the fly was a prisoner of war .
His aunt detected the act and made him let it go .
`` I forgive everybody , Sid .
Tell 'em so , Sid .
They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time , apprehensively , as if they feared they might be followed .
and Huckleberry began to snuffle too .

Three miles below St. Petersburg , at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide , there was a long , narrow , wooded island , with a shallow bar at the head of it , and this offered well as a rendezvous .
It was not inhabited ; it lay far over toward the further shore , abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest .
Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them .
And before the afternoon was done , they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would `` hear something . ''
`` What would the boys say if they could see us ? ''
`` What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for ? ''
Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go .
Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont , in her good-night to Sid and Mary .
The silences widened ; the expectoration marvellously increased .
Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main .
Well , it 's just Muff Potter , Muff Potter , Muff Potter all the time .
`` Yes , sir . ''
Why , they used to fight all the time .

`` That 's it , '' said he .
`` That 's the very trouble .
We got to give this one up .
We ca n't ever tell the right time , and besides this kind of thing 's too awful , here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so .
I feel as if something 's behind me all the time ; and I 'm afeard to turn around , becuz maybe there 's others in front a-waiting for a chance .
`` The ha'nted house .
By-and-by , one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave , panting , hilarious , smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings , daubed with clay , and entirely delighted with the success of the day .
The quicker the better -- I 'm all in a shiver . ''
`` Well , poor chap , you do look as if you 'd had a hard night of it -- but there 's a bed here for you when you 've had your breakfast .
No , they ai n't dead , lad -- we are sorry enough for that .
You see we knew right where to put our hands on them , by your description ; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them -- dark as a cellar that sumach path was -- and just then I found I was going to sneeze .
I was in the lead with my pistol raised , and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path , I sung out , 'Fire boys ! '
As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing , and went down and stirred up the constables .
My boys will be with them presently .
But you could n't see what they were like , in the dark , lad , I suppose ? ''
Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply .
They rose up and wandered along , hand in hand and hopeless .
They found one presently , and Tom said it was time to rest again .
Huck began to dig and scratch now .
They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock .
He followed its winding course , first to the right , then to the left , Huck at his heels .
Tom turned a short curve , by-and-by , and exclaimed :
Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that .
But I was young , I was but seven years of age , and vain , foolish , and anxious to attract attention .
I wrote the biography , and have never been in a respectable house since .
We must save the word from this destruction .
There is but one way to do it , and that is , to stop the spread of the privilege , and strictly confine it to its present limits : that is , to all the Christian sects , to all the Hindu sects , and me .
Let this suffice , of the conversation .
It is enough for us to know that the prayers , the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured girl availed nothing .
The King looked pleased with this encouragement , coming as it did from so excellent authority , and continued with good heart --
Tom 's face showed inquiring surprise ; and a blush followed when he saw Lord St. John 's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him .
`` Give me the cup , then , and make speed , make speed ! ''
`` 'T is a strange folly .
`` Then where is thy blame ?
Explain -- speak out . ''
I am an archangel ! ''
`` Oh , my Edith , my darling -- ''
The jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh , and said --
At midnight of the 19th of February , Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in his rich bed in the palace , guarded by his loyal vassals , and surrounded by the pomps of royalty , a happy boy ; for tomorrow was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England .
Let us change the tense for convenience .
These were conducted ceremoniously to their seats , and their coronets placed conveniently at hand ; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest , for most of them were beholding for the first time , dukes , earls , and barons , whose names had been historical for five hundred years .
When all were finally seated , the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete ; a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember .
The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity , then he said , with grave respectfulness --
`` To think , Mary -- he BELIEVES in me . ''
`` No -- kept it to destroy us with .
Mary , he has exposed us to some already .
Ah , he would n't answer our nod of recognition -- he knew what he had been doing ! ''
'Surely not every ill , every decay ? '
The past teaches us that , in order to succeed , a movement like this must not be a mere philosophy , it must be a religion ; also , that it must not claim entire originality , but content itself with passing for an improvement on an existing religion , and show its hand later , when strong and prosperous -- like Mohammedanism .
She would not allow the dentist to use cocaine , but sat there and let him punch and drill and split and crush the tool , and tear and slash its ulcerations , and pull out the nerve , and dig out fragments of bone ; and she would n't once confess that it hurt .
There is an account of a boy who got broken all up into small bits by an accident , but said over the Scientific Statement of Being , or some of the other incantations , and got well and sound without having suffered any real pain and without the intrusion of a surgeon .
'But I did n't walk -- no .
I sold one picture every day , and never tried to sell two .
I always said to my customer :
At any rate , I was not celebrated and I did not give the banquet .
I was a Literary Person , but that was all -- a buried one ; buried alive .
We have made good time and course to-day .
Writing is a rather precarious thing these times .
It is to the credit of the men that they did not kill the rooster that crowed so gallantly mornings .
Thirty years ago Haimberger went off on a long voyage in a sailing-ship .
Each of the five acts contains an independent tragedy of its own .
In each act someone's edifice of hope , or of ambition , or of happiness , goes down in ruins .
In the first act the pagans persecute Zoe , the Christian girl , and a pagan mob slaughters her .
In the fourth act those same pagans -- now very old and zealous -- are become Christians , and they persecute the pagans ; a mob of them slaughters the pagan youth , Nymphas , who is standing up for the old gods of his fathers .
'That was a good stroke of diplomacy -- three good strokes of diplomacy , in fact . '
The conductor 's face lost something of its complacency ; in fact , it settled to a quite sober cast as the owner of it moved away .
The effect was satisfactory .
There was an awkward silence for a minute or more ; then the hedging and the half-confessions of over-haste and exaggerated resentment began , and soon everything was smooth and friendly and sociable , and it was resolved to drop the matter and leave the boy 's bread and butter unmolested .
'Did you object to the game ? '
The persecuted President leaned back in his chair , closed his eyes , clasped his hands in his lap , and a look of pathetic resignation crept over his long face .
It is the way a country schoolmaster used to look in days long past when he had refused his school a holiday and it had risen against him in ill-mannered riot and violence and insurrection .
There was but one way for Dr. Lecher to hold the floor -- he must stay on his legs .
If he should sit down to rest a moment , the floor would be taken from him by the enemy in the Chair .
Wolf was now appeased , and withdrew his own thousand-times-offered motion , and Dr. Lecher 's was voted upon -- and lost .
I think that Saltpeter never uttered a truer thing than when he said , 'Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad . '

When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave -- folded up -- in one hand , and the newspaper in the other ; and it gave me more than half a pang to see him .
His cheerfulness was all gone , and he looked old and pinched and ashy .
And then -- only think of the things he had to listen to !
Mamma , he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan 's own authorized editions down below .
His applause tasted bitter in his mouth , though ; he could not disguise that from me ; and it was observable that his appetite was gone ; he only nibbled ; he could n't eat .
October is the time -- 1900 ; Hope Canyon is the place , a silver-mining camp away down in the Esmeralda region .
For inhabitants , the camp has about two hundred miners , one white woman and child , several Chinese washermen , five squaws , and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes , battered plug hats , and tin-can necklaces .
There are no mills as yet ; there is no church , no newspaper .

The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence ; held it in the air a few moments ; then , in brief , crisp terms he put forward question after question , and noted the answers with `` Um-ums , '' nods of the head , and so on .
By this process he learned all about Flint Buckner , his character , conduct , and habits , that the people were able to tell him .
Mr. Holmes smiled compassionately upon the witness , and asked , languidly --

A first-class steamer , to be under his own command , and capable of accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers , will be selected , in which will be taken a select company , numbering not more than three-fourths of the ship 's capacity .
We also had a mock trial .
A judge was appointed ; also clerks , a crier of the court , constables , sheriffs ; counsel for the State and for the defendant ; witnesses were subpoenaed , and a jury empaneled after much challenging .
Occasionally , merely for the pleasure of being cruel , we put unoffending Frenchmen on the rack with questions framed in the incomprehensible jargon of their native language , and while they writhed we impaled them , we peppered them , we scarified them , with their own vile verbs and participles .
We could not bring ourselves to think St. John had two sets of ashes .
But we followed into a large room filled with tall wooden presses like wardrobes .
He threw them open , and behold , the cargoes of `` crude bullion '' of the assay offices of Nevada faded out of my memory .
San Paolo be my witness that did ye but find the stout Count Leonardo in his cups , sheer from the castle 's topmost battlements would he hurl ye all !
`` No -- thousan ' year before he is born . ''
What we saw there was simply a circular crater -- a circular ditch , if you please -- about two hundred feet deep , and four or five hundred feet wide , whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference .
In the centre of the great circus ring thus formed , was a torn and ragged upheaval a hundred feet high , all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many a brilliant and beautiful color , and the ditch inclosed this like the moat of a castle , or surrounded it as a little river does a little island , if the simile is better .
The sulphur coating of that island was gaudy in the extreme -- all mingled together in the richest confusion were red , blue , brown , black , yellow , white -- I do not know that there was a color , or shade of a color , or combination of colors , unrepresented -- and when the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tinted magnificence , it topped imperial Vesuvius like a jeweled crown !
On every hand was heard the complaints of women , the wailing of children , and the cries of men .
One called his father , another his son , and another his wife , and only by their voices could they know each other .
One of the boys said :
he said it would be `` very severe '' -- that was all we could get out of him .
When they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid robes , I shall feel bound to observe that all the Emperors that ever I was personally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes , and did not swagger .
We returned to Constantinople , and after a day or two spent in exhausting marches about the city and voyages up the Golden Horn in caiques , we steamed away again .
We passed through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles , and steered for a new land -- a new one to us , at least -- Asia .
`` Rode to-day , altogether , thirteen hours , through deserts , partly , and partly over barren , unsightly hills , and latterly through wild , rocky scenery , and camped at about eleven o'clock at night on the banks of a limpid stream , near a Syrian village .
Two horses lame ( mine and Jack 's ) and the others worn out .
Fun -- but of a mild type . ''
I would not have gone into this dissertation upon Syrian villages but for the fact that Nimrod , the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety , is buried in Jonesborough , and I wished the public to know about how he is located .
Like Homer , he is said to be buried in many other places , but this is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit .
The very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp , all burning up and dusty , is to hunt up a bath .
We followed the stream up to where it gushes out of the mountain side , three hundred yards from the tents , and took a bath that was so icy that if I did not know this was the main source of the sacred river , I would expect harm to come of it .
It was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the Abana , `` River of Damascus , '' that gave me the cholera , so Dr. B. said .
We asked him why , but he said it was no matter .
We asked him why , once or twice , as we walked back to the camp but he still said it was no matter .
But late at night , when he was sitting in a thoughtful mood on the bed , we asked him again and he said :
-- we 'll give him one ! ''
The punishment was `` suspended , '' at the fifteenth blow to hear the confession .
There were other places where the Lord fell , and others where he rested ; but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on this morning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary , was a certain stone built into a house -- a stone that was so seamed and scarred that it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face .
The projections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionate kisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands .
The guide said it was because this was one of `` the very stones of Jerusalem '' that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the people to cry `` Hosannah ! ''
One of the pilgrims said , `` But there is no evidence that the stones did cry out -- Christ said that if the people stopped from shouting Hosannah , the very stones would do it . ''
They looked like very young kids , but they annihilated distance like an express train .
I have not seen animals that moved faster , unless I might say it of the antelopes of our own great plains .
The grotto was tricked out in the usual tasteless style observable in all the holy places of Palestine .
As in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , envy and uncharitableness were apparent here .
They had it every where on signs .
No other princes had stopped there since , till Jack and I came .
The weather was very hot , it had been many a day since Jack had seen ice-cream , and so it was useless to talk of leaving the saloon till it shut up .
`` Hear , O high and mighty mandarin , and believe !
`` Well , you will , and he will dim even those ruddy fires and look like a transfigured Adonis backed against a pink sunset . ''

Papa was born in Missouri .
Steve whipped out his revolver and shot its head off .
We ran down there to pick up the bird , and just then , sure enough , Mr. Laird and his people came over the ridge , and they joined us .
But Orion did n't notice that this was an unpleasant expression .
The old gentleman took him into the parlor , set the candle on a table , and stood .
Orion made the usual remarks about the weather , and sat down -- sat down and talked and talked and went on talking -- that old man looking at him vindictively and waiting for his chance -- waiting treacherously and malignantly for his chance .
It was understood that a young fellow came to see the girl of the house , not the founder of it .
It does n't deceive .
Their idea is to get me drunk and leave me under the table , and from their standpoint this will be very funny .
My parents removed to Missouri in the early thirties ; I do not remember just when , for I was not born then , and cared nothing for such things .
Recently some one in Missouri has sent me a picture of the house I was born in .
The house was a double log one , with a spacious floor ( roofed in ) connecting it with the kitchen .
For instance , the corn bread , the hot biscuits and wheat bread , and the fried chicken .
The North seldom tries to fry chicken , and this is well ; the art can not be learned north of the line of Mason and Dixon , nor anywhere in Europe .
This is not hearsay ; it is experience that is speaking .
In Europe it is imagined that the custom of serving various kinds of bread blazing hot is `` American , '' but that is too broad a spread ; it is custom in the South , but is much less than that in the North .
Our word describes water made from melted ice -- a drink which we have but little acquaintance with .
Their clothing makes a great opera audience an enchanting spectacle , a delight to the eye and the spirit , a Garden of Eden for charm and color .
The men , clothed in dismal black , are scattered here and there and everywhere over the Garden , like so many charred stumps , and they damage the effect , but can not annihilate it .
She passed , as they passed , in her youth and beauty , and nothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory .
The young man was quite willing .
I found no fault in him .
On the contrary , I believed in him at once , and was solicitous to heal the wounds inflicted by Dolby 's too frank incredulity ; therefore I did everything I could think of to cheer him up and entertain him and make him feel at home and comfortable .
His face lighted joyfully at that , and he said that if I could only sell a small manuscript to Tom Hood 's Annual for him it would be the happiest event of his sad life and he would hold me in grateful remembrance always .
That was a most pleasant night for three of us , but Dolby was disgusted and sarcastic .
We were ashamed of him again , and said so .
But in Austria the rules of the game do not provide against danger , they carefully provide _for_ it , usually .
How do you come to know about it ? ''
`` 'I am the doubter and the doubt -- '
We were together a month or two in Venice and several months in Rome , afterwards , and one day that lamented break of mine was mentioned .
Well , the C. 's comforted me , but they did not persuade me to continue to think about the unhappy episode .
He mused a moment or two and then said ,
Clinton was refined by nature and breeding ; he was a gentleman by nature and breeding ; he was highly educated ; he was of a beautiful spirit ; he was pure in heart and speech .
He had n't a vice -- unless a large and grateful sympathy with Scotch whiskey may be called by that name .
`` No -- three dollars .
I think so because they fixed up a bedroom for him in the Boinville house .
One does n't need a bedroom if one is only going to run over now and then in a disconnected way to respond like a tremulous instrument to every breath of passion or of sentiment and rub up one 's Italian poetry a little .
Yet he has been resting both for a month , with Italian , and tea , and manna of sentiment , and late hours , and every restful thing a young husband could need for the refreshment of weary limbs and a sore conscience , and a nagging sense of shabbiness and treachery .
Once , when she was tucking him back in its cradle again , the other child nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention .
`` Oh , we do n't mind it at all , madam ; in our case it was merely misfortune , and nobody 's fault .
His estates were confiscated , his personal property seized , and there we were , in Germany , strangers , friendless , and in fact paupers .
Also , we were marvelous musical prodigies -- if you will allow me to say it , it being only the truth .

`` Now come , '' said Luigi , `` it is very pleasant to hear you say these things , but for unselfishness , or heroism , or magnanimity , the circumstances wo n't stand scrutiny .
If I had let the man kill him , would n't he have killed me , too ?
Tom looked at him a moment or two , then shook his head sorrowfully and said :
About the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out , Pembroke Howard was entering the next house to report .

A deafening explosion of applause was the answer .
You have heard us grant that claim , and welcome it . ''
'We had n't nothing else to do , so we kept on watching it .
By and by I says --
I had been reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an expedition sent out by our government .
I had thirty dollars left ; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon .
I never was great in matters of detail .
The cries of the leadsmen went on -- and it is a weird sound , always , in the night .
Every pilot in the lot was watching now , with fixed eyes , and talking under his breath .
He would put his wheel down and stand on a spoke , and as the steamer swung into her ( to me ) utterly invisible marks -- for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea -- he would meet and fasten her there .
The very tone of the question shook my confidence .
I began to imagine all sorts of things .
Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck ; next the chief mate appeared ; then a clerk .
Chapter 14 Rank and Dignity of Piloting
I supposed I was booked for the penitentiary sure , and could n't be booked any surer if I went on and squared my long account with this person while I had the chance ; consequently I stuck to him and pounded him with my fists a considerable time -- I do not know how long , the pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was ; -- but in the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel : a very natural solicitude , for , all this time , here was this steamboat tearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody at the helm !
However , Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full stage , and correspondingly long and deep ; and the boat was steering herself straight down the middle and taking no chances .
While we lay at landings , I listened to George Ealer 's flute ; or to his readings from his two bibles , that is to say , Goldsmith and Shakespeare ; or I played chess with him -- and would have beaten him sometimes , only he always took back his last move and ran the game out differently .
'This , ' putting his hand on a backing-bell rope , 'is to sound the fire-alarm ; this , ' putting his hand on a go-ahead bell , 'is to call the texas-tender ; this one , ' indicating the whistle-lever , 'is to call the captain ' -- and so he went on , touching one object after another , and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies .
Charles Augustus Murray ( near St. Louis ) , seven years later --
I watched closely , but could not guess the intent .
'A man perhaps perfectly contented now , there in Mannheim , surrounded by his own class , eating his bread with the appetite which laborious industry alone can give , enjoying his humble life , honest , upright , pure in heart ; and BLEST !

just you lay fifteen hundred dollars before a man like that , and say -- '
Its metal will preserve it from the hackings and chippings which so defaced its predecessor , which was of marble ; but the brick foundations are crumbling , and it will tumble down by-and-bye .
It overlooks a picturesque region of wooded hills and ravines ; and is not unpicturesque itself , being well smothered in flowering weeds .

You are going to see the day , pretty soon , when you ca n't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with , in any hotel in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys , outside of the biggest cities .
Why , we are turning out oleomargarine NOW by the thousands of tons .
And we can sell it so dirt-cheap that the whole country has GOT to take it -- ca n't get around it you see .
There 's more money in oleomargarine than -- why , you ca n't imagine the business we do .
Shores lonely no longer .
A most home-like and happy-looking region .
And now and then you see a pillared and porticoed great manor-house , embowered in trees .
Here is testimony of one or two of the procession of foreign tourists that filed along here half a century ago .
Sir Walter has got the advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl and rosary , and he will stay .
This was the source of much talk and speculation among parties directly interested .
The letter was sent to one of our ladies , who is a Sunday-school teacher , -- sent either by Williams himself , or the chaplain of the State 's prison , probably .
She has been greatly annoyed in having so much publicity , lest it might seem a breach of confidence , or be an injury to Williams .

He said he had no title .
Beyond this remark he was economical of the truth .
The first thing he did in Australia was to get into the lockup , and the next thing he did was to proclaim himself an earl in the police court in the morning and fail to prove it .
There are several sorts of ills in the world from which a person can never escape altogether , let him journey as far as he will .
We have come far from the snake liar and the fish liar , and there was rest and peace in the thought ; but now we have reached the realm of the boomerang liar , and sorrow is with us once more .
This being received with a large silence that suggested doubt , he buttressed it with the statement that his brother once saw the boomerang kill a bird away off a hundred yards and bring it to the thrower .
But these are ills which must be borne .
There is no other way .
It is a good game .
We play it in this ship .
A quartermaster chalks off a diagram like this-on the deck .
The child will never know its own birthday .
For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said as much as ten days ago , that if the child was born on his birthday he would give it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with .
His birthday was Monday , the 9th of September .
It was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and reverence for their persons still survive in the native commoner , and in great force .
The educated young gentleman who is chief of the tribe that live in the region about the capital dresses in the fashion of high-class European gentlemen , but even his clothes can not damn him in the reverence of his people .
I had a glimpse of him down in the town .
Perhaps he is a descendant of the last king -- the king with the difficult name whose memory is preserved by a notable monument of cut-stone which one sees in the enclosure in the middle of the town .
It is easier to preserve it on a granite block than in your head .
On board the Duncan Dunbar , flying toward Sydney Heads in the waning afternoon , the happy home-comers made busy preparation , for it was not doubted that they would be in the arms of their friends before the day was done ; they put away their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeter for the meeting , their richest and their loveliest , these poor brides of the grave .
But the wind lost force , or there was a miscalculation , and before the Heads were sighted the darkness came on .
He did not find out that he was wrong until it was too late .
`` What , you are not going ? ''
A boat upsets now and then , by accident , a result of tumultuous skylarking ; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun -- such as it is with sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence .
Tragedies have happened more than once .
The curtain was up .
It would not fall until the mastership of one party or the other was determined -- and permanently :
The native landed on the other side of the horse with the hat fairly on his head .
The prodigious height of the leap , and the precision with which it was taken so as to enable him to dip his head into the hat , exceeded any feat of the kind I have ever beheld . ''
I do not know .
It is a tree that can get along without water ; still it is fond of it -- ravenously so .
It is a very intelligent tree and will detect the presence of hidden water at a distance of fifty feet , and send out slender long root-fibres to prospect it .
Once a cement water-pipe under ground at Stawell began to gradually reduce its output , and finally ceased altogether to deliver water .
He did not say it was through his influence that all these things had happened -- for that would have been coarse ; he merely conveyed that idea ; conveyed it so subtly that I only caught it fleetingly , as one catches vagrant faint breaths of perfume when one traverses the meadows in summer ; conveyed it without offense and without any suggestion of egoism or ostentation -- but conveyed it , nevertheless .
`` And you 'll shake hands with me ? ''
Yes , when the Moment comes , the Man appears -- even if he is a thousand miles away , and has to be discovered by a practical joke .
Twenty minutes for luncheon .
It was his way of saying `` very good . ''
Also , there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper , a noble great creature with a benignant countenance , standing by a table .
You could see that he was just a shade higher than the table -- indeed , a huge fellow for a dog .
Then there was a description which went into the details .
The pictures and the figures so impressed me , that I could see the beautiful colossus before me , and I kept on thinking about him for the next two hours ; then I reached New York , and he dropped out of my mind .
`` I 'll tell you .
Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within his jurisdiction , and that the worst of them were merely thieves ; but Feringhea told him that he was in reality living in the midst of a swarm of professional murderers ; that they had been all about him for many years , and that they buried their dead close by .
It was a staggering business .
The evidence gathered proved the truth of what Feringhea had said , and also revealed the fact that gangs of Thugs were plying their trade all over India .
The Thugs were harried and hunted from one end of India to the other .
The fire used is sacred , of course -- for there is money in it .
Sometimes a rich mourner pays a thousand rupees for it .
Every detail connected with the matter costs something , and helps to fatten a priest .
I suppose it is quite safe to conclude that that fire-bug is in holy orders .
If a gentleman sent up his carriage , the chit stated `` from '' such-and-such an hour `` to '' such-and-such an hour -- which made it unhandy for the coachman and his two or three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark of their own .
And the city itself is a curiosity .
This is Portuguese allover -- indolence , piousness , poverty , impotence .
Jameson would have to ride 150 miles .
But a telegraph wire had been overlooked and not cut .
It spread the news of his invasion far and wide , and a few hours after his start the Boer farmers were riding hard from every direction to intercept him .
From Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st ( the day after Johannesburg heard of the invasion ) , `` The Reform Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson's inroad . ''
Several long journeys -- gave us experience of the Cape Colony railways ; easy-riding , fine cars ; all the conveniences ; thorough cleanliness ; comfortable beds furnished for the night trains .
It was in the first days of June , and winter ; the daytime was pleasant , the nighttime nice and cold .
The vigor and freshness and inspiration of the air and the sun -- well , it was all just as Olive Schreiner had made it in her books .
I saw Table Rock , anyway -- a majestic pile .
It is 3,000 feet high .
I got them in Cape Town from the two best-informed citizens , men who had made Table Rock the study of their lives .
I saw the Government , also the Parliament , where they quarreled in two languages when I was there , and agreed in none .
The sole occupations of the people were farming and fishing ; their sole recreation , religious services .
Once in three or four years a ship touched there , moved them with aged news of bloody battles , devastating epidemics , fallen thrones , and ruined dynasties , then traded them some soap and flannel for some yams and breadfruit , and sailed away , leaving them to retire into their peaceful dreams and pious dissipations once more .
This turned the Duke of Bethany into tolerably open malcontent and a secret conspirator -- a thing which the emperor foresaw , but could not help .
Thus did my uncle .
He tried Aztec inscriptions and stuffed whales -- another failure , after incredible labor and expense .
My uncle hastened to secure these noble gems .
He got the stuffed whale , but another collector got the inscription .
His stepfather had married a distant relative of mine who was afterward hanged ; and so he seemed to think a blood relationship existed between us .
He desired to look at my new chimney-pot hat .
Said he would send me the address of his hatter .
He said , `` No one will know now where you got it .
Mind , he did this while his own hat sat offensively near our noses , on the table -- an ancient extinguisher of the `` slouch '' pattern , limp and shapeless with age , discolored by vicissitudes of the weather , and banded by an equator of bear 's grease that had stewed through .
Then the Cooper miracles began .

I have been all over this land , from end to end , and now I am back again since day before yesterday , to that city which we passed through , that last day of our long journey , and which is near her country home .
I wish I could hear it once more ; it would revive me , it would bring back her face and the mountains and the free life , and I would come -- if I were dying I would come !
However , it did no further damage , except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out .
I do n't know what we ought to do .
Now the doctor said he would make the child cough harder and dislodge the trouble .
Then I lampooned two prominent citizens outrageously -- not because they had done anything to deserve , but merely because I thought it was my duty to make the paper lively .
( I do n't know what balm is , but I believe it is the correct expression to use in this connection -- never having seen any balm . )
You may remember that I lectured in Newark lately for the young gentlemen of the -- -- -Society ?
During the afternoon of that day I was talking with one of the young gentlemen just referred to , and he said he had an uncle who , from some cause or other , seemed to have grown permanently bereft of all emotion .
I said : `` My son , bring the old party round .
Then the young man blessed me , and wept on my neck , and went after his uncle .
Never a ghost of a smile , and never a suspicion of moisture !
I closed the lecture at last with one despairing shriek -- with one wild burst of humor , and hurled a joke of supernatural atrocity full at him !
Therefore another interval of rest and silence ensued -- an interval which lasted four years -- viz till 1858 .
What did Floyd do ?
`` Profound mind ! ''
said Professor Angle-Worm to Professor Field-Mouse ; `` profound mind !
About noon a great avenue was reached , which had in it two endless parallel bars of some kind of hard black substance , raised the height of the tallest Bull Frog above the general level .
But at last the bald and venerable geographer , Professor Mud Turtle , a person who , born poor , and of a drudging low family , had , by his own native force raised himself to the headship of the geographers of his generation , said :
It 'll pay . ''
And still the packed audience waited , for it was a prodigious occasion in Bull 's Corners , and one in which every father of a family was necessarily interested .
I do not wish to write of the personal habits of these strange creatures solely , but also of certain curious details of various kinds concerning them , which , belonging only to their private life , have never crept into print .
It referred to the uniform and inevitable fine of forty shillings and costs for uttering a party cry -- and it is no economical fine for a poor man , either , by the way .
The officer smelt a fine -- informers get half .
I was bewildered beyond description .
`` He was a member of Congress once , and a good one .
He would have finished the crowd by this time , only he had to get out here .
Thus I am here . '
The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed with despatch that night , and out at the back door also , while the `` outraged and insulted public '' surged in the front way , breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came , and taking off such property as they could carry when they went .
It has a better chance to grow and prosper and achieve permanency than any other existing `` ism '' ; for it has more to offer than any other .
The past teaches us that in order to succeed , a movement like this must not be a mere philosophy , it must be a religion ; also , that it must not claim entire originality , but content itself with passing for an improvement on an existing religion , and show its hand later , when strong and prosperous -- like Mohammedanism .
Nothing contrivable by human invention could be more formidably effective than that , in banishing imaginary ailments and in closing the entrances against sub-sequent applicants of their breed .
I have no pain ; there 's no such thing as pain !
I think that that is only a small part of it .
I think that the secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere .
Only for a moment .
Yet he should not be so , since he has had no chance to examine his catch , and can not know whether it is going to help his contention or damage it .
The context thinks it explains who the victim was , but it does nothing of the kind .
They passed , and left a vacancy .
She knows that if you wish to confer upon a human being something which he is not sure he wants , the best way is to make it apparently difficult for him to get it -- then he is no son of Adam if that apple does not assume an interest in his eyes which it lacked before .
The man born two centuries from now will think he has arrived in hell ; and all in good time he will think he knows it .
Vast concentrations of irresponsible power have never in any age been used mercifully , and there is nothing to suggest that the Christian Science Papacy is going to spend money on novelties .
But her acts are consistent .
Mrs. Eddy 's known and undisputed writings are very limited in bulk ; they exhibit no depth , no analytical quality , no thought above school composition size , and but juvenile ability in handling thoughts of even that modest magnitude .
I am quite sure that Mrs. Eddy can not write well upon any subject , even a commercial one .
You do n't think he is sick , do you , ma ? ''
You would not have me do a thing which I regard as a sin ? ''
Nothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone on direct examination .
`` About what hour was the kick delivered ? ''
The doctor inspected and dressed the wounds .
`` There , '' he said , `` that will fix the patient ; give his brother a dipperful every three-quarters of an hour -- ''
The good father hugged her yet closer to his side and said :
She had not seen the shadow yet .
Had the song of the birds told her it was coming ?
Yes , there might be no doubt of that .
I went the next afternoon , and took an obscure lodging ; the next day I called at the castle and paid my respects to the governor , who invited me to dine with him at noon of the following day .
He was an ideal soldier of the time ; tall , brawny , gray-headed , rough , full of strange oaths acquired here and there and yonder in the wars and treasured as if they were decorations .
He had been used to the camp all his life , and to his notion war was God 's best gift to man .
It shriveled up the King 's little soul like a raisin , with terrors and apprehensions , and straightway he privately appointed a commission of bishops to visit and question Joan daily until they should find out whether her supernatural helps hailed from heaven or from hell .
`` But do n't swear .
No , I should have said it was not in me ; but it was .
The man answered with unsmiling simplicity :
When we reached the gate , Joan told Gaucourt to open it and let her pass .
You could have knocked the Paladin down with a feather .
And are you satisfied with me now ? ''
La Hire gave his plumed helm an impatient toss and burst out with :
`` Fair duke , step out of your tracks , or that machine will kill you . ''
`` Constellation , says you ?
-- perhaps that may assist . ''
`` Cap'n , ai n't you pretty physically tired ? ''
`` Well , you can see one to-night if you want to .
There 's a barkeeper from Jersey City going to be received . ''
I knew Charles the Second very well -- one of the most popular comedians in the English section -- draws first rate .
There are better , of course -- people that were never heard of on earth -- but Charles is making a very good reputation indeed , and is considered a rising man .
Henry the Eighth is a tragedian , and the scenes where he kills people are done to the very life .
Henry the Sixth keeps a religious-book stand . ''
You see , everybody knows that if he had had a chance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have made all generalship before look like child 's play and 'prentice work .
However , as I say , everybody knows , now , what he WOULD have been , -- and so they flock by the million to get a glimpse of him whenever they hear he is going to be anywhere .
Caesar , and Hannibal , and Alexander , and Napoleon are all on his staff , and ever so many more great generals ; but the public hardly care to look at THEM when HE is around .
THE TREATY WITH CHINA ITS PROVISIONS EXPLAINED New York Tribune , Tuesday , August 28 , 1868 Every one has read the treaty which has just been concluded between the United States and China .
It will interest many of your readers to know why this , that , and the other provision was incorporated in the treaty ; it will interest others to know in what manner and to what extent the treaty will affect our existing relations with China .
Apart from its grave importance , the subject is really as entertaining as any I know of and -- asking pardon for the presumption -- I desire to write a few paragraphs upon it .
In or near one or two of the cities of China the Emperor has set apart certain tracts of land for occupation by foreigners .
They levy and collect taxes , they pave their streets , they light them with gas .
This doctrine was really held , notwithstanding the supremacy of China over these tracts of land was recognized at regular intervals in the most substantial way , viz.
Again , these foreign communities took it upon themselves to levy taxes upon Chinamen residing upon their so-called `` concessions , '' and enforce their collection .
Also ( in the final sentence ) its control over scattering foreigners ( of nationalities not in treaty relations with China ) not enrolled the regular concessions is `` granted . ''
Article 1 of this treaty pledges that like offenses shall not be committed in Chinese waters by American cruisers , and looks to Chinese protection of American ships against such outrages .
Yet the clause has its significance .
It will surprise many whose notion of Chinamen is that they are a race who formerly manifested their interest in shipwrecked strangers by exhibiting them in iron cages in public , in a half-starved condition , as rare and curious monsters , to know that a few hundred years ago they welcomed adventurous Jesuit priests , who struggled to their shores , with great cordiality , and gave to them the fullest liberty in the dissemination of their doctrines .
But the caging and barbecuing of strangers were disagreeable attentions which were secured to those strangers by their predecessors .
They listened to their preachings , they joined their Church .
The Jesuit priests were elevated to high offices in the Government .
However , to pursue my narrative , some priests of the Dominican order arrived , and very shortly began to make trouble .
When strangers came , after that , the Chinese , with that calm wisdom which comes only through bitter experience , caged them , or hanged them .
Article 2 of the treaty is intended to discountenance all officious intermeddling with the Government 's business by Americans , and so move a step toward the restoration of that Chinese confidence in strangers which was annihilated so long ago .
And soon -- perhaps within a year or two -- there will doubtless be a Chinese Envoy located permanently at Washington .
These pastimes are lost to them forever .
I have seen dogs almost tear helpless Chinamen to pieces in broad daylight in San Francisco , and I have seen hod-carriers who help to make Presidents stand around and enjoy the sport .
California is one of the most liberal and progressive States in the Union , and the best and worthiest of her citizens will be glad to know that the days of persecuting Chinamen are over , in California .
It is sad to reflect that in this respect the ignorant Chinese are strangely like ourselves and other civilized peoples .
How precisely like our civilized , Christianized , enlightened selves these Chinese `` men and brethren '' are !
The farmers of great Massachusetts turned out en masse , armed with axes , and resisted the laying of the first railroad track in that State .
Thirty years ago , the concentrated wisdom of France , in National Assembly convened , gravely pronounced railroads a `` foolish , unrealizable toy . ''
In Tuscany , the people rose in their might and swore there should be bloodshed before a railroad track should be laid on their soil .
Let us be lenient with the little absurd peculiarities of the Chinese , for manifestly these people are our own blood relations .
Let us look charitably now upon a certain very serious obstacle which lies in the way of their sudden acceptance of a great railroad system .
Let us remember that China is one colossal graveyard -- a mighty empire so knobbed all over with graves that the level spaces left are hardly more than alleys and avenues among the clustering death-mounds .
These graves are as precious as their own blood to the Chinese , for they worship their dead as ancestors .
The railways must be built , though .
That China is anxious to build railways is shown in the fact that by the latest news from there , just officially enunciated to our State Department , it appears that the Viceroy of the three chief provinces of the Empire is about to begin a railroad from Suchow to Shanghai -- 80 miles -- or , at least , has the project under serious consideration .
I want it . ''
That pleased the old man till he could n't rest .
But he said HE was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for HIM .
Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner .
Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket ( so he could n't drip ) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house .
I took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking .
Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too , you might say , in the season .
I dropped pap's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident .
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it wouldn't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again .
The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore .
`` I couldn ' git nuffn else , '' he says .
`` Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast , Jim ? ''
Pretty soon she says ,
I was feeling better then , but I wished I was out of there , anyway .
Then we 'll wait .
Now I say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more'n two hours befo ' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river .
He 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self .
I reckon that 's a considerble sight better 'n killin ' of him .
I'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ain't good sense , it ai n't good morals .
Ai n't I right ? ''
Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that !
But it war n't no time to be sentimentering .
So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , too -- seemed a week before we got to the stern .
But I said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure .
We struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water .
When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff , sure enough !
I felt ever so thankful .
In another second I would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened .
The seegars was prime .
He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure .
Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger .
Mos ' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery .
Yit dey say Sollermun de wises ' man dat ever live ' .
But you take a man dat 's got 'bout five million chillen runnin ' roun ' de house , en it 's diffunt .
A chile er two , mo ' er less , warn't no consekens to Sollermun , dad fatch him ! ''
Has I ben a-drinkin ' ?
Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin ' ? ''
`` Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and don't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? ''
`` Our ole raf ' . ''
The raft was gone !
I could n't get my breath for most a minute .
Then I raised a yell .
But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble .
If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
`` Run her nose in shore , '' says the king .
`` Wher ' you bound for , young man ? ''
`` You DEAR good souls !
`` Yes -- regular . ''
I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha'n't ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll PRAY for you , too ! ''
-- and she was gone .
I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice .
`` You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names . ''
Then he did n't look so joyful , and says :
I must go up the road and waylay him .
The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me .
Do n't I generly know what I'm about ? ''
-- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV.
, nor none of them heroes ?
Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ?
Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are .
Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is .
If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one . ''
It 's because they 're hungry ; that 's the reason .
You make them a witch pie ; that 's the thing for YOU to do . ''
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he would n't ever get out .
The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says :
His eyes just blazed ; and he says :
`` DAH , now , Huck , what I tell you ?
I TOLE you I got a hairy breas ' , en what 's de sign un it ; en I TOLE you I ben rich wunst , en gwineter to be rich AGIN ; en it 's come true ; en heah she is !
But as to merit -- the personal merit of the victorious coward's project and achievement ?
Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid and peaceful man to --
UP to YOUR limit .
ITS PRESENCE IS YOUR LIMIT .
Presently you will reach a new stage of development , then your progress will be easier ; will proceed on a simpler basis , anyway .
From the teapot he evolved the cylinder -- from the displaced lid he evolved the piston-rod .
The one implies untrammeled power to ACT as you please , the other implies nothing beyond a mere MENTAL PROCESS : the critical ability to determine which of two things is nearest right and just .
It is in no way altered .
When it failed of that , the whole of its value was gone .
The only value it possesses , for even a moment , is the spiritual value back of it : remove that and and it is at once worthless -- like the hat .
We all use the `` I '' in this indeterminate fashion , there is no help for it .
To me , Man is a machine , made up of many mechanisms , the moral and mental ones acting automatically in accordance with the impulses of an interior Master who is built out of born-temperament and an accumulation of multitudinous outside influences and trainings ; a machine whose ONE function is to secure the spiritual contentment of the Master , be his desires good or be they evil ; a machine whose Will is absolute and must be obeyed , and always IS obeyed .
Beyond this gateway arises the vast bulk of the Jungfrau , a spotless mass of gleaming snow , into the sky .
The somber frame and the glowing snow-pile are startlingly contrasted .
There are many mountains of snow that are as lofty as the Jungfrau and as nobly proportioned , but they lack the frame .
They stand at large ; they are intruded upon and elbowed by neighboring domes and summits , and their grandeur is diminished and fails of effect .
AMENABLE , anything that is mean .
The law of fluid pressure divide the different forms of organized bodies by the form of attraction and the number increased will be the form .
She was all right , not a scratch on her , not a timber started anywhere .
Then he limped out to position , and we resumed once more .
They are merely a couple of chunks of plaster of Paris .
One is , of course , thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated the fact that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training , but I may be forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance to his pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone , Lord Campbell , Judge Holmes , Mr. Castle , K.C.
, Lord Penzance , Mr. Grant White , and other lawyers , who have expressed their opinion on the matter of Shakespeare 's legal acquirements ... .

`` Oh , listen to the man !
He did n't reply ; there was n't anything to say .
The end was come ; all knew it .
With a great sob Hester gathered her to her breast , crying , `` Oh , my child , my darling ! ''
A rapturous light broke in the dying girl's face , for it was mercifully vouchsafed her to mistake those sheltering arms for another 's ; and she went to her rest murmuring , `` Oh , mamma , I am so happy -- I longed for you -- now I can die . ''
The evasion failed , of course .
The moment the family seated themselves at the table -- '' Excuse my absence for a short time , '' said she , `` while I attend to the placing of those flowers , which should have been done a week ago . ''
And away she ran to the sacred grove , surrounded with glittering pearls , that indicated her coming .
They meet -- Ambulinia 's countenance brightens -- Elfonzo leads up his winged steed .
`` Mount , '' said he , `` ye true-hearted , ye fearless soul -- the day is ours . ''
`` Lend thy aid , ye strong winds , '' they exclaimed , `` ye moon , ye sun , and all ye fair host of heaven , witness the enemy conquered . ''
`` Hold , '' said Elfonzo , `` thy dashing steed . ''
They passed the day in thanksgiving and great rejoicing , and on that evening they visited their uncle , where many of their friends and acquaintances had gathered to congratulate them in the field of untainted bliss .
It was delightful to be in such a place , after long weeks of daily and nightly familiarity with miners ' cabins -- with all which this implies of dirt floor , never-made beds , tin plates and cups , bacon and beans and black coffee , and nothing of ornament but war pictures from the Eastern illustrated papers tacked to the log walls .
That was all hard , cheerless , materialistic desolation , but here was a nest which had aspects to rest the tired eye and refresh that something in one 's nature which , after long fasting , recognizes , when confronted by the belongings of art , howsoever cheap and modest they may be , that it has unconsciously been famishing and now has found nourishment .
I could not have believed that a rag carpet could feast me so , and so content me ; or that there could be such solace to the soul in wall-paper and framed lithographs , and bright-colored tidies and lamp-mats , and Windsor chairs , and varnished what-nots , with sea-shells and books and china vases on them , and the score of little unclassifiable tricks and touches that a woman 's hand distributes about a home , which one sees without knowing he sees them , yet would miss in a moment if they were taken away .
H. Dear me , what has INFLUENCE to do with such a matter ?
So , you knew her uncle ; her uncle knows her literature ; he endorses it to you ; the chain is complete , nothing further needed ; you are satisfied , and therefore --
Baby Mills was a comfort to everybody about him .
General attention was thus drawn to the poor fellow , and a great many people came forward and helped him toward reform with their countenance and encouragement .
They cleaned him up , they fed him , they listened to the mournful music of his repentances , they got him his situation again .
The air was rent with applause , and everybody cried for joy .
`` EBBI POLLI , I had chickens ! ''
Very often , of course , the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub , point , snapper , or whatever you like to call it .
My mother assented , and said :
We wo n't to see all that is it remarquable here .
There is it also hospitals here ?
In time it will develop , though I think it will not be sudden ; and besides , there is no hurry ; he is well enough just as he is .
`` So next morning all the children of Israel and their parents and the other people gathered themselves together .
They prayed an hour -- two hours -- three hours -- and so on , plumb till noon .
He graveled the prophets of Baal every way he could think of .
I objected that this would require too lingering a death ; it was a good speech for a consumptive , but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor .
We wrangled over a good many ante-mortem outbursts , but I finally got him to cut his obituary down to this , which he copied into his memorandum-book , purposing to get it by heart :
Perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time ? ''
`` You have made the fatal arrangements -- I see it in your eye ! ''
These were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on .

The people often stepped aboard the raft , as we glided along the grassy shores , and gossiped with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or so , then stepped ashore again , refreshed by the ride .
`` And what a tail he had ! ''
`` Just an hour ago . ''
`` Bless your soul , no !
But we 've been all around -- Paris and everywhere .
Ca n't enter till I know German .
It 's awful undermining to the intellect , German is ; you want to take it in small doses , or first you know your brains all run together , and you feel them sloshing around in your head same as so much drawn butter .
I ai n't any more afraid of French than a tramp 's afraid of pie ; I can rattle off my little J'AI , TU AS , IL A , and the rest of it , just as easy as a-b-c .
About the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the Felsenthor , formed by two enormous upright rocks , with a third lying across the top .
At ten minutes past six we reached the Kaltbad station , where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery .
-- for there is no opiate like Alpine pedestrianism .
But when we got up abreast it on its own level , mountains were towering high above on every hand , and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before .

`` My mind is made up . ''
We watched the weather all through that awful night , and kept an eye on the barometer , to be prepared for the least change .
There was not the slightest change recorded by the instrument , during the whole time .
If I should be in such a situation again , I should not wish for any barometer but that one .
Mr. Hudson , and I .
To insure steady motion , one tourist and one native walked together .
This accident occurred in 1866 , a year and a month after the disaster on the Matterhorn .
These huge brass tubes , mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed skyward from every choice vantage-ground , have the formidable look of artillery , and give the town the general aspect of getting ready to repel a charge of angels .
All the morning the tubes remained directed toward the mountain heights , each with its anxious group around it ; but the white deserts were vacant .
Here we camped and breakfasted .
Either America is healthier than Europe , notwithstanding her `` deadly '' indulgence in ice-water , or she does not keep the run of her death-rate as sharply as Europe does .
The tables might as well have been stereotyped , they varied so little .
I saw that dandy 's curious game played afterward , in Paris , but not for amusement ; not with a motive of any sort , indeed , but simply from a selfish indifference to other people 's comfort and rights .
`` Yes , the Old Masters often drew badly ; they did not care much for truth and exactness in minor details ; but after all , in spite of bad drawing , bad perspective , bad proportions , and a choice of subjects which no longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago , there is a SOMETHING about their pictures which is divine -- a something which is above and beyond the art of any epoch since -- a something which would be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to attain it , and therefore do not worry about it . ''
I bought them to start a portrait-gallery of my ancestors with .
I paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the princess .
One can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these , in Europe , if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for chances .
Strictly speaking , ZUG means Pull , Tug , Draught , Procession , March , Progress , Flight , Direction , Expedition , Train , Caravan , Passage , Stroke , Touch , Line , Flourish , Trait of Character , Feature , Lineament , Chess-move , Organ-stop , Team , Whiff , Bias , Drawer , Propensity , Inhalation , Disposition : but that thing which it does NOT mean -- when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on , has not been discovered yet .
Armed just with these two , and the word ALSO , what can not the foreigner on German soil accomplish ?
The German word ALSO is the equivalent of the English phrase `` You know , '' and does not mean anything at all -- in TALK , though it sometimes does in print .
Fifthly , I would do away with those great long compounded words ; or require the speaker to deliver them in sections , with intermissions for refreshments .
To wholly do away with them would be best , for ideas are more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when they come in bulk .
Intellectual food is like any other ; it is pleasanter and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel .
`` How much for this precious library , just as it stands , all complete ? ''
`` Going -- going -- ''
' Says Longfellow , 'It do n't begin with my `` Biglow Papers . ''
' Says Holmes , 'My `` Thanatopsis '' lays over 'em both . '
They mighty near ended in a fight .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
My first American ancestor , gentlemen , was an Indian -- an early Indian .
Your ancestors skinned him alive , and I am an orphan .
Not one drop of my blood flows in that Indian 's veins today .
I stand here , lone and forlorn , without an ancestor .
They skinned him alive -- and before company !
Think how he must have felt ; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed .
But he was not a bird , gentlemen , he was a man , and probably one of the most undressed men that ever was .
I ask it as a favor ; I ask it as a tardy act of justice ; I ask it in the interest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors ; I ask it that the world may contemplate , with vision unobstructed by disguising swallow-tails and white cravats , the spectacle which the true New England Society ought to present .
Cease to come to these annual orgies in this hollow modern mockery -- the surplusage of raiment .
Come in character ; come in the summer grace , come in the unadorned simplicity , come in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors provided for mine .
However , chaff and nonsense aside , I think I honor and appreciate your Pilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves , perhaps ; and I endorse and adopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once -- a man of sturdy opinions , of sincere make of mind , and not given to flattery .
He said : `` People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock , but , after all's said and done , it would be pretty hard to improve on those people ; and , as for me , I do n't mind coming out flatfooted and saying there ai n't any way to improve on them -- except having them born in , Missouri ! ''
He had been invited to an exercise at Columbia , and upon inquiry had been told that it was usual to wear the black gown : Later he had found that three other men wore bright gowns , and he had lamented that he had been one of the black mass , and not a red torch .
`` You must wear it , '' they told me ; `` why , just think of going to Washington without a plug-hat ! ''
But I said no ; I would wear a derby or nothing .
Why , I believe I could walk along the streets of New York -- I never do -- but still I think I could -- and I should never see a well-dressed man wearing a plug-hat .
If I did I should suspect him of something .
