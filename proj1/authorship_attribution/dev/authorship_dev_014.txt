I never knew one to be so long getting its growth .
It has fur on its head now ; not like kangaroo fur , but exactly like our hair , except that it is much finer and softer , and instead of being black is red .
I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak .
It grieves me to the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion .
It might be lonelier than ever ; for since I can not find another one , how could it ?
In 1880 Mark took a few pot shots at license in Art and Literature in his Tramp Abroad , `` I wonder why some things are ?
Fielding and Smollet could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language ; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day , but we are not allowed to approach them very near , even with nice and guarded forms of speech .
But not so with Art .
The brush may still deal freely with any subject ; however revolting or indelicate .
Nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps ; nobody can help noticing it now , the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous .
Though ye sinless hosts of heaven had foretold ye coming of this most desolating breath , proclaiming it a work of uninspired man , its quaking thunders , its firmament-clogging rottenness his own achievement in due course of nature , yet had not I believed it ; but had said the pit itself hath furnished forth the stink , and heaven's artillery hath shook the globe in admiration of it .
He was working in the printing-office of John A .
He must have written more than once during this period , but the next existing letter -- also to Sister Pamela -- was written in October .
To Mrs. Clemens and Mrs. Moffett , in St. Louis :
DEAR BROTHER , -- I just received yours and Mollies letter yesterday -- they had been here two weeks -- forwarded from St. Louis .
They have struck the ledge in the Live Yankee tunnel , and I told the President , Mr. Allen , that it was n't as good as the croppings .
He is much of a gentleman , that man Allen .
which question , I beg humbly to observe , is of a general nature , and not discharged particularly at you .
You know I have extravagant hopes , for Orion tells you everything which he ought to keep to himself -- but it 's his nature to do that sort of thing , and I let him alone .
Do not tell any one that I had any idea of piloting again at present -- for it is all a mistake .
Mr. Burlingame went with me all the time , and helped me question the men -- throwing away invitations to dinner with the princes and foreign dignitaries , and neglecting all sorts of things to accommodate me .
It is nearly impossible to imagine humor in this extract , yet it is a fair sample of the entire letter .
I said I didn't want any of the pie .
God knows I am mean enough and lazy enough , now , without being a foreign consul .
In company with Nasby Clemens , that season , also met Oliver Wendell Holmes .
Later he had sent Holmes a copy of his book and received a pleasantly appreciative reply .
`` for the benefit of my natural heirs '' -- the same being my mother , for Livy would n't claim it , you may be sure of that .
This has taken $ 200 out of my pocket which I was going to send to Ma .
To Dr. John Brown , in Edinburgh :
Thy soul , my soul , two souls entwine , And sing thy lauds in crystal wine ! ''
Which is natural enough , since I am a person who would quit authorizing in a minute to go to piloting , if the madam would stand it .
But what I am coming at , is this : wo n't you and Mrs. Howells come down Saturday the 22nd and remain to the Club on Monday night ?
Please tell Aldrich I 've got a photographer engaged , and tri-weekly issue is about to begin .
Mrs. Clemens says my version of the blindfold novelette `` A Murder and A Marriage '' is `` good . ''
Which reminds me that a campaign club in Jersey City wrote a few days ago and invited me to be present at the raising of a Tilden and Hendricks flag there , and to take the stand and give them some `` counsel . ''
Harte 's play can be doctored till it will be entirely acceptable and then it will clear a great sum every year .
Following the Sellers success , Clemens had made many attempts at dramatic writing .
Such undertakings had uniformly failed , but he had always been willing to try again .
In the next letter we get the beginning of what proved his first and last direct literary association , that is to say , collaboration , with Bret Harte .
A work similar to your new one in the Atlantic is what I mean , though I have not heard what the nature of that one is .
Well , you are right .
Howells says he is going to make his next book indelicate .
He says he thinks there is money in it .
However , we convinced them ; and then , instead of saying something , or going on crying , they grew very still -- words could not express it , I suppose .
Frankfort was a brief halting-place , their destination being Heidelberg .
They were presently located there in the beautiful Schloss hotel , which overlooks the old castle with its forest setting , the flowing Neckar , and the distant valley of the Rhine .
Clemens , who had discovered the location , and loved it , toward the end of May reported to Howells his felicities .
I have a pleasant work-room a mile from here where I do my writing .
We staid three weeks in Venice , a week in Florence , a fortnight in Rome , and arrived here a couple of weeks ago .
There are mountains and mountains and mountains in this world -- but only these take you by the heart-strings .
It is a longing -- a deep , strong , tugging longing -- that is the word .
I should like that first rate .
Now only think of it !
He still has 100 pages to write on his lecture , yet in one inking of his pen he has already swooped around the United States and invested the result !
The aspect of the balance-sheet is enlightening .
I expect to complete it in a month or six weeks or two months more .
These two , working together , let their imaginations run riot with disastrous results .
I 've got the first volume launched safely ; consequently , half of the suspense is over , and I am that much nearer the goal .
We 've bound and shipped 200,000 books ; and by the 10th shall finish and ship the remaining 125,000 of the first edition .
Sha n't have so much trouble , this time , though , if we get to press pretty soon , because we can get more binderies then than are to be had in front of the holidays .
I find it takes 7 binderies four months to bind 325,000 books .
-- It is perilous to write such a man .
You can go crazy on less material than anybody that ever lived .
What in hell has produced all these maniacal imaginings ?
You told me you had hired an attendant for ma .
Now hire one instantly , and stop this nonsense of wearing Mollie and yourself out trying to do that nursing yourselves .
Hire the attendant , and tell me her cost so that I can instruct Webster & Co. to add it every month to what they already send .
Do n't fool away any more time about this .
You see I 've read only the first page of your letter ; I would n't read the rest for a million dollars .
It is heart-breaking to see Mrs. Crane .
I do see that there is an argument against suicide : the grief of the worshipers left behind ; the awful famine in their hearts , these are too costly terms for the release .
I salute you , my darling .
P. S. Just finished the above and finished raging at the eternal German tax-gatherer , and so all the jubilant things which I was going to say about the past year 's business got knocked out of me .
Now rush me along the Annual Report and let 's see how we feel !
This is just the place for her .
We leave here in about ten days , but the doctors have changed our plans again .
I think we shall be in Bohemia or thereabouts till near the end of September , then go to Paris and take a rest .
I went with Laffan to the Racquet Club the other night and played , billiards two hours without starting up any rheumatism .
Livy darling , Yesterday I talked all my various matters over with Mr. Rogers and we decided that it would be safe for me to leave here the 7th of March , in the New York .
So his private secretary , Miss Harrison , wrote and ordered a berth for me and then I lost no time in cabling you that I should reach Southampton March 14 , and Paris the 15th .
... One thing at a time .
When it reaches you it will mean that there is a hitch in my machine-enterprise -- a hitch so serious as to make it take to itself the aspect of a dissolved dream .
And will you tell Irving for me -- I can't get up courage enough to talk about this misfortune myself , except to you , whom by good luck I have n't damaged yet that when the wreckage presently floats ashore he will get a good deal of his $ 500 back ; and a dab at a time I will make up to him the rest .
Mrs. Hutton writes to ask me to interest rich Englishmen in her case , and I would gladly try , but my secluded life will not permit it .
Three of the 6 were born in slavery , the others were children of slaves .
We went down to the village hotel and bought our tickets and entered the beer-hall , where a crowd of German and Swiss men and women sat grouped at round tables with their beer mugs in front of them -- self-contained and unimpressionable looking people , an indifferent and unposted and disheartened audience -- and up at the far end of the room sat the Jubilees in a row .
The Singers got up and stood -- the talking and glass jingling went on .
Then rose and swelled out above those common earthly sounds one of those rich chords the secret of whose make only the Jubilees possess , and a spell fell upon that house .
It was fine to see the faces light up with the pleased wonder and surprise of it .
No one was indifferent any more ; and when the singers finished , the camp was theirs .
It reminded me of Launcelot riding in Sir Kay 's armor and astonishing complacent Knights who thought they had struck a soft thing .
The Jubilees sang a lot of pieces .
It is utterly beautiful , to me ; and it moves me infinitely more than any other music can .
I think that in the Jubilees and their songs America has produced the perfectest flower of the ages ; and I wish it were a foreign product , so that she would worship it and lavish money on it and go properly crazy over it .
J. H. Twichell , in Hartford :
RIVERDALE , N. Y. , Oct. 31 , '02 .
Clara runs the house smoothly and capably .
VILLA DI QUARTO , May 11 , '04
The Baroness is a little afraid of her English , therefore she will write her remarks in French -- I said there 's a plenty of translators in New York .
An hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine went silent out of this house , and I am as one who wanders and has lost his way .
She who is gone was our head , she was our hands .
We are now trying to make plans -- we : we who have never made a plan before , nor ever needed to .
If she had known she was near to death she would have told us where to go and what to do : but she was not suspecting , neither were we .
April 30 , 1905 .
DEAR MR. FULTON , -- I remember , as if it were yesterday , that when I disembarked from the overland stage in front of the Ormsby in Carson City in August , 1861 , I was not expecting to be asked to come again .
It ought to be ably illustrated .
In spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him , there recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print of one which , years before , Sarony had made and placed on public sale .
Whenever he saw it he recalled Sarony with bitterness and severity .
Once he received an inquiry concerning it , and thus feelingly expressed himself .
And what do you want to go and discourage the other flowers for ?
Is that the right spirit ?
Why , it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial , of course ; and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be .
The reading brings vividly back to me my pet and pride .
Clemens remained at Stormfield all that winter .
He was constantly invited to this or that public gathering , or private party , but such affairs had lost interest for him .
He preferred the quiet of his luxurious home with its beautiful outlook , while for entertainment he found the billiard afternoons sufficient .
Guests came from the city , now and again , for week-end visits , and if he ever was restless or lonely he did not show it .
In this letter he seems to have forgotten that his trouble had been pronounced an affection of the heart long before he left America , though at first it had been thought that it might be gastritis .
The same mail brought a letter from Mr. Allen explaining fully the seriousness of his condition .
I sailed immediately for Bermuda , arriving there on the 4th of April .
He was not suffering at the moment , though the pains came now with alarming frequency and violence .
He was cheerful and brave .
`` No , but he 'll want to know , wo n't he ? ''
`` That 's it -- and most gladly reciprocate -- ''
Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more baskets ? ''
The essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of bygone times , and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress .
But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the production of that result .
Now I have been looking over a list of inventors -- the creators of this amazing material development -- and I find that they were not college-bred men .
It is not overstatement to say that the imagination-stunning material development of this century , the only century worth living in since time itself was invented , is the creation of men not college-bred .
They have reconstructed this nation -- made it over , that is -- and metaphorically speaking , have multiplied its numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express .
Merely the numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by courtesy men and women ?
In 1840 our population was 17,000,000 .
It was Hattie 's ghost over again , merely turned around .
Tracy , do n't put this kind of a strain on me .
`` Oh , danke schon !
The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever .
He felt a good deal put out .
He said to himself , with a deep sense of injury , `` He 'll put in his diary -- they all keep diaries -- he 'll put in his diary that she was miraculously uninteresting -- dear , dear , but was n't she !
I 've had enough ; I 'll haul down my flag -- the others may fight it out if they want to . ''
Do you know , I have n't the heart to degrade such a character as that down to the burglar estate for money or for anything else ; and I 've come to ask if you are willing to let the reward go , and leave this poor fellow -- ''
She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud .
The portrait of Sellers , by Tracy , was fighting along , day by day , through this mixed weather , and daily adding to itself ineradicable signs of the checkered life it was leading .
It was the happiest portrait , in spots , that was ever seen ; but in other spots a damned soul looked out from it ; a soul that was suffering all the different kinds of distress there are , from stomach ache to rabies .
He said he had as many different kinds of emotions in him as a jug .
Should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched business ?
Yes -- at least the most of it -- it ought to be done .
Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the laboratory .
And then my newspaper correspondence dropped out , and he took a chance in that -- manuscript letters written for the home papers .
After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car , and , as it was Sabbath eve , intoned some of the grand old hymns -- '' Praise God from whom , '' etc .
Then to bed in luxurious couches , where we slept the sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning ( Monday ) at eight o'clock , to find ourselves at the crossing of the North Platte , three hundred miles from Omaha -- fifteen hours and forty minutes out . ''
One of these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his system for nearly seven years after the massacre ; and another of them told me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the Indians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself , he could not restrain his tears , for his clothes were completely ruined .
The coach we were in had a neat hole through its front -- a reminiscence of its last trip through this region .
He said the place to keep a man `` huffy '' was down on the Southern Overland , among the Apaches , before the company moved the stage line up on the northern route .
[ Two pistol shots ; a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet , as if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object ; several heavy , dull blows , as with a club ; a voice that said appealingly , `` Do n't , gentlemen , please do n't -- I 'm a dead man ! ''
Slade soon gained a name for fearless resolution , and this was sufficient merit to procure for him the important post of overland division-agent at Julesburg , in place of Mr. Jules , removed .
Unquestionably it was time .
So he wrote to Shiz , asking a cessation of hostilities , and offering to give up his kingdom to save his people .
In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on him for four days , dispersing the populace , interrupting business , and destroying children , and never got a bid -- at least never any but the eighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make .
Then the auctioneer brought in his bill , and I withdrew the horse from the market .
We tried to trade him off at private vendue next , offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones , old iron , temperance tracts -- any kind of property .
Finally I tried to give him away .
His face lit up eagerly at first , but toned down again , and he said the thing would be too palpable .
Then one of the men said :
It was growing late , too -- three or four in the afternoon .
By and by , powerful as my comrade was , his great exertions began to tell on him , and he was anxious that I should change places with him till he could rest a little .
And so it went on .
By three o'clock we found it was no use , and so we got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise .
`` Just as you say . ''
`` Now you talk like a rational being .
`` Oh certainly -- no particular hurry . ''
The reason why there was so much slaughtering done , was , that in a new mining district the rough element predominates , and a person is not respected until he has `` killed his man . ''
Of course it could not get along without an original novel , and so we made arrangements to hurl into the work the full strength of the company .
Mrs. F. was an able romancist of the ineffable school -- I know no other name to apply to a school whose heroes are all dainty and all perfect .
Mr. F. followed next week , with a brilliant lawyer who set about getting the Duke 's estates into trouble , and a sparkling young lady of high society who fell to fascinating the Duke and impairing the appetite of the blonde .
-- Accompanied by a fellow reporter , we made a trip through our Chinese quarter the other night .
We found Mr. Hong Wo , No .
`` Tom , '' who speaks faultless English , and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial Enterprise , when the establishment kept bachelor 's hall two years ago , said that `` Sometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap , ketch um two tree hundred , sometime no ketch um anything ; lottery like one man fight um seventy -- may-be he whip , may-be he get whip heself , welly good . ''
Where will you find another like it in the Western hemisphere ?
Every one was amazed at the man 's rashness .
The retreat came to a halt ; then everybody sat down again wondering , to await the upshot of it .
The thought is pregnant with interest . )
I 'm not connected in any way with the Government . ''
He had the good taste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work with .
While he was in view there was but one man who attracted more attention than himself , and that was Harris ( the Yankee Prime Minister ) .
I knew it was not a rat this time , and I thought it might be a centipede , because the Captain had killed one on deck in the afternoon .
The first glance at the pillow showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it -- cockroaches as large as peach leaves -- fellows with long , quivering antennae and fiery , malignant eyes .
I had often heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors ' toe nails down to the quick , and I would not get in the bunk any more .
I lay down on the floor .
In a few moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder , and taking a bite every time they struck .
I was beginning to feel really annoyed .
Terrible moments drifted slowly by , and still the King ate , still he lived , still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld !
the tabu is broken ! ''
Some say that that wise old pagan , Kamehameha I planned and built it , but others say it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions .
The stones are worn and smooth , and pushed apart in places , so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of Rome which one sees in pictures .
`` But , my dear sir , there was nothing remarkable about that horse , or the circumstance either -- nothing in the world !
How she could whirl a buggy along !
I started her out once , sir -- Colonel Bilgewater , you recollect that animal perfectly well -- I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the awfullest storm I ever saw in my life , and it chased us upwards of eighteen miles !
It did , by the everlasting hills !
It was depressingly still , and miserably cold .
Mike knew all this , and was in the joke , but I suspected nothing of it .
To me it was most uncomfortably genuine .
The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the massacre : these statements are shown , not only by Cradlebaugh and Rodgers , but by a number of military officers , and by J. Forney , who was , in 1859 , Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory .
The remarkable assertion made to me by Mr. Winters , that pity only spared my life on Wednesday evening last , almost compels me to believe that at first he could not have intended me to leave that room alive ; and why I was allowed to , unless through mesmeric or some other invisible influence , I can not divine .
`` Do n't want anybody fur to learn the business , 'tai n't likely ? ''
The next morning I found a similar group at the foot of the stairs , and scattering couples and individuals standing here and there in the street , and over the way , watching me with interest .
I waited a minute , to let that idea shudder its way home , and then said :
If you went out at night , your servants carried torches .
There were no books , pens , paper or ink , and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows .
It is a little thing -- glass is -- until it is absent , then it becomes a big thing .
But perhaps the worst of all was , that there wasn't any sugar , coffee , tea , or tobacco .
I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island , with no society but some more or less tame animals , and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did -- invent , contrive , create , reorganize things ; set brain and hand to work , and keep them busy .
Well , that was in my line .
I not only watched this tournament from day to day , but detailed an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and Agriculture , and ordered him to report it ; for it was my purpose by and by , when I should have gotten the people along far enough , to start a newspaper .
A newspaper has its faults , and plenty of them , but no matter , it 's hark from the tomb for a dead nation , and don't you forget it .
I said I had seen one -- and that it would last until it had an Established Church .
I will say you , said Sir Gawaine , it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen , and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause , and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen , and to be loved again , and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of -- ''
Of the chief feature of the feast -- the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start -- nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt ; and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes .
So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness .
She resisted ; but I was expecting that .
But she finally consented .
I was expecting that , too , but not so soon .
That about ended my discomfort .
These were down under the castle's foundations , and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock .
Some of these cells had no light at all .
But they had never got an answer ; and at last that question was not asked any more -- or any other .
Not that I would ever engage in it as a business , for I would n't .
It 's just a corner in pork , that 's all , and you ca n't make anything else out of it .
Your head 's all right , as far as it goes , but you do n't know business ; that 's where the trouble is .
As I understand it , Sir Gawaine killed seven of his sons , and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to take into camp .
`` That , it meseemeth , might well be , '' said the abbot , who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster , `` for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness .
I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper ; the Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change ; is around the corner yet .
I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence , respect , deference , so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me :
They were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it . ''
And it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting .
This man is a pretender , and ignorant , else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only , and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea . ''
`` Yes -- that was the way of it .
`` -- Sir Driant , Sir Lambegus , Sir Herminde , Sir Pertilope , Sir Perimones , and -- whom do you think ? ''
But there would be no reinforcements ; this was the last stand of the chivalry of England ; it was all that was left of the order , after the recent annihilating wars .
I therefore issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words :
I believed I knew what project they would attempt , because it was plainly the thing I would attempt myself if I were in their places and as ignorant as they were .
I tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave , and made sure that they were all right ; I tested and retested those which commanded the fences -- these were signals whereby I could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at will .
Sentry-duty was discarded for the night , and the corral left empty of life ; I ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave , and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer .
They brought no armor of offense but their swords ; as a rule , they carried the sword ready in the hand , and put it forward and found the wires with it .
We would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us ; but we knew what had happened , all the same ; poor fellow , he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted .
Ole missis , she tole me I got to go an ' git dis water an ' not stop foolin ' roun ' wid anybody .
`` Oh , SHALL !
In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together , embracing its head with its arms , and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body , and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view ; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails ; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe .
And Sid , you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town , and tell her -- ''
`` It 's devil-fire .
Oh , Tom , this is awful . ''
`` If he 's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being , he wo n't think of the knife till he 's gone so far he 'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself -- chicken-heart ! ''
`` YOU bad ! ''
`` Consound it , Tom Sawyer , you 're just old pie , 'longside o ' what I am .
One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt 's yellow cat came along , purring , eying the teaspoon avariciously , and begging for a taste .
They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour -- which was midnight .
There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture .
The Red-Handed made no response , being better employed .
In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard , and feeling very melancholy .
But she found nothing there to comfort her .
Sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house .
It was this : `` Pretty thin -- as long a dream as that , without any mistakes in it ! ''
`` Well , that 's the foolishest thing you could do .
I been creeping all over , ever since I got here . ''
`` Well , what 's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime !
`` I 'm dead for sleep !
It 's your turn to watch . ''
`` Well , if it 's got to be done , let 's get at it .
I tried to keep it back , but no use -- 't was bound to come , and it did come !
So did the boys .
But they were off in a jiffy , those villains , and we after them , down through the woods .
I judge we never touched them .
I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals -- 'twould help a good deal .
Both were cruelly tired , yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther .
She could not understand it .
Then Becky broke the silence :
Some boards were soon uncovered and removed .
He stooped and passed under ; the narrow way descended gradually .
How fortunate it would have been for me if I had heeded them .
But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects , he is naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence .
`` Let a non-professional man , however acute , '' writes Lord Campbell again , `` presume to talk law , or to draw illustrations from legal science in discussing other subjects , and he will speedily fall into laughable absurdity . ''
Stratfordians , as is well known , casting about for some possible explanation of Shakespeare 's extraordinary knowledge of law , have made the suggestion that Shakespeare might , conceivably , have been a clerk in an attorney 's office before he came to London .
Mr. Collier wrote to Lord Campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true .
His answer was as follows : `` You require us to believe implicitly a fact , of which , if true , positive and irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it .
Not having been actually enrolled as an attorney , neither the records of the local court at Stratford nor of the superior Courts at Westminster would present his name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney , but it might reasonably have been expected that there would be deeds or wills witnessed by him still extant , and after a very diligent search none such can be discovered . ''
`` Perhaps the simplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in early life he was in an attorney 's office ( ! )
, that he there contracted a love for the law which never left him , that as a young man in London , he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement , to stroll in leisure hours into the Courts , and to frequent the society of lawyers .
The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the mutual relations of all departments of knowledge .
We do not need any more , the stock is watered enough , just as it is .
And now finally I must uncover the secret pain , the wee sore from which the Reply grew -- the anecdote which closed my recent article -- and consider how it is that this pimple has spread to these cancerous dimensions .
If any but you had dictated the Reply , M. Bourget , I would know that that anecdote was twisted around and its intention magnified some hundreds of times , in order that it might be used as a pretext to creep in the back way .
But I accuse you of nothing -- nothing but error .
They nor anything could move the stout old lord of Klugenstein .
Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before -- the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands , and set upon and torn by dogs .
`` Ah , be merciful , thou !
The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken dumb .
The Lord Chancellor entered , and knelt by the King 's couch , saying --
The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and exclaimed --
Will he keep ? ''
What riddle is this ?
Am I in truth gone mad , or is it thou ?
`` Good sir , what is this man 's offence ? ''
Fly , and save yourself . ''
At that same hour , Edward , the true king , hungry and thirsty , soiled and draggled , worn with travel , and clothed in rags and shreds -- his share of the results of the riot -- was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster Abbey , busy as ants : they were making the last preparation for the royal coronation .
The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke , and said in a dead voice --
The time drifted along -- one hour -- two hours -- two hours and a half ; then the deep booming of artillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at last ; so the waiting multitude rejoiced .
`` Good -- is he within ? ''
We 'll find your names in the lot . ''
This was received with great enthusiasm , the dog taking a hand again ; the saddler started the bids at a dollar , the Brixton folk and Barnum's representative fought hard for it , the people cheered every jump that the bids made , the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher , the bidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring , more and more determined , the jumps went from a dollar up to five , then to ten , then to twenty , then fifty , then to a hundred , then --
I know it -- I know it well .
'Well , I should say so !
I 'd rather own it than the equator . '
'Could you try it some more ways ? '
I have ridden ever since .
Yesterday the third mate mended the block , and this P.M. the sail , after some difficulty , was got down , and Harry got to the top of the mast and rove the halyards through after some hardship , so that it now works easy and well .
We could only reward Harry by an extra ration of water .
It is a picturesque detail ; and so is that rainbow , too -- the only one seen in the forty-three days , -- raising its triumphal arch in the skies for the sturdy fighters to sail under to victory and rescue .
There were fifteen passengers on board .
'Now I begin to see .
Yes , it was indeed remarkable . '
Take note of some of the details of the piece .
No remark is made about this picturesque failure of civilisation ; but there it stands , as an unworded suggestion that civilisation , even when Christianised , was not able wholly to subdue the natural man in that old day -- just as in our day the spectacle of a shipwrecked French crew clubbing women and children who tried to climb into the lifeboats suggests that civilisation has not succeeded in entirely obliterating the natural man even yet .
Common sailors a year ago , in Paris , at a fire , the aristocracy of the same nation clubbed girls and women out of the way to save themselves .
And in still another panic of fright we have this same tough civilisation saving its honour by condemning an innocent man to multiform death , and hugging and whitewashing the guilty one .
'You are at perfect liberty to resume your game , gentlemen ; no one here objects . '
At this point the train conductor arrived , and was going to shut down the game in a very high-handed fashion , but the parlour-car conductor stopped him , and took him aside to explain .
Votes upon motions , whether carried or defeated , could make endless delay , and postpone the Ausgleich to next century .
When he had been talking three or four hours he himself proposed an adjournment , in order that he might get some rest from his wearing labours ; but he limited his motion with the condition that if it was lost he should be allowed to continue his speech , and if it was carried he should have the floor at the next sitting .

The lawyer for the prostitution jumps up all excited , and says :
`` For about two weeks now there 's been a little bill sticking on the front of this courthouse offering two thousand dollars reward for a couple of big di'monds -- stole at St. Louis .
Them di'monds is worth twelve thousand dollars .
But never mind about that till I get to it .
Now about this murder .
And more than that , he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them .

We love to hear them prate and drivel and lie .
They always throw out a few feelers ; they never cast themselves adrift till they have sounded every individual and know that he has not traveled .
They will not let you know anything .
They sneer at your most inoffensive suggestions ; they laugh unfeelingly at your treasured dreams of foreign lands ; they brand the statements of your traveled aunts and uncles as the stupidest absurdities ; they deride your most trusted authors and demolish the fair images they have set up for your willing worship with the pitiless ferocity of the fanatic iconoclast !
I love them for their witless platitudes , for their supernatural ability to bore , for their delightful asinine vanity , for their luxuriant fertility of imagination , for their startling , their brilliant , their overwhelming mendacity !
After dinner we felt like seeing such Parisian specialties as we might see without distressing exertion , and so we sauntered through the brilliant streets and looked at the dainty trifles in variety stores and jewelry shops .

The figure was that of a man without a skin ; with every vein , artery , muscle , every fiber and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail .
It looked natural , because somehow it looked as if it were in pain .
I am very sorry I saw it , because I shall always see it now .
I shall dream of it sometimes .
I shall dream that it is resting its corded arms on the bed 's head and looking down on me with its dead eyes ; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with me and touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs .
The furniture of the narrow chamber of death we had just visited weighed six millions of francs in ounces and carats alone , without a penny thrown into the account for the costly workmanship bestowed upon them !
The treasures here , by simple weight , without counting workmanship , were valued at fifty millions of francs !

Many in their despair begged that death would come and end their distress .
Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like that of Scylla and Charybdis .
What were sunsets to us , who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual Athens ; yea , and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person for the slaves , Diogenes and Plato , in the public market-place , or gossip with the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of Marathon ?
We inquired of every body who came near the ship , whether there were guards in the Piraeus , whether they were strict , what the chances were of capture should any of us slip ashore , and in case any of us made the venture and were caught , what would be probably done to us ?
The answers were discouraging : There was a strong guard or police force ; the Piraeus was a small town , and any stranger seen in it would surely attract attention -- capture would be certain .
The commandant said the punishment would be `` heavy ; '' when asked `` how heavy ? ''
And when they come on the stage attended by a vast body-guard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates , it will be my duty as well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of my acquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person .

Jack and I walked three or four miles , over the hills , and led the horses .

He said , calmly , `` This is one of the stones that would have cried out . ''
It was of little use to try to shake this fellow 's simple faith -- it was easy to see that .
So , rested and refreshed , we fell into line and filed away over the barren mountains of Judea , and along rocky ridges and through sterile gorges , where eternal silence and solitude reigned .
They were gazelles , of `` soft-eyed '' notoriety .
A quarter of a mile away was Bethlehem of Judea , and the pilgrims took some of the stone wall and hurried on .
A silver star set in the floor bears a Latin inscription to that effect .
We found the hotel and secured rooms , and were happy to know that the Prince of Wales had stopped there once .
We went abroad through the town , then , and found it a city of huge commercial buildings , and broad , handsome streets brilliant with gas-light .
By night it was a sort of reminiscence of Paris .
But finally Jack found an ice-cream saloon , and that closed investigations for that evening .
And he went off growling to himself and still wondering and wondering over the unaccountable conduct of No .
His mother is Grandma Clemens ( Jane Lampton Clemens ) of Kentucky .
Which reminds me of Rev .
Charley Stowe 's little boy -- a little boy of seven years .
Charley crossing his mother 's grounds one morning and he told me this little tale .
He had been out to Chicago to attend a Convention of Congregational clergymen , and had taken his little boy with him .
He said : `` We shall be the guests of a clergyman , there will be other guests -- clergymen and their wives -- and you must be careful to let those people see by your walk and conversation that you are of a godly household .
The admonition bore fruit .
And when Laird 's second saw that bird , with its head shot off , he lost color , he faded , and you could see that he was interested .
He hammered and hammered at the door ; could n't get any response ; did n't understand it .
But Orion did n't draw inferences , he merely hammered and hammered , and finally the father of the girl appeared at the door in a dressing-gown .
He had a candle in his hand and the dressing-gown was all the clothing he had on -- except an expression of unwelcome which was so thick and so large that it extended all down his front to his instep and nearly obliterated the dressing-gown .
It was not customary .
`` It 's a poor invention .
But they do n't know me .
It was a long journey in those days , and must have been a rough and tiresome one .
It is more than the best man in history ever did for any other town .
It may not be modest in me to refer to this , but it is true .
Fried chicken , roast pig , wild and tame turkeys , ducks and geese ; venison just killed ; squirrels , rabbits , pheasants , partridges , prairie-chickens ; biscuits , hot batter cakes , hot buckwheat cakes , hot `` wheat bread , '' hot rolls , hot corn pone ; fresh corn boiled on the ear , succotash , butter-beans , string-beans , tomatoes , pease , Irish potatoes , sweet-potatoes ; buttermilk , sweet milk , `` clabber '' ; watermelons , musk-melons , cantaloups -- all fresh from the garden -- apple pie , peach pie , pumpkin pie , apple dumplings , peach cobbler -- I can't remember the rest .
The way that the things were cooked was perhaps the main splendor -- particularly a certain few of the dishes .
These things have never been properly cooked in the North -- in fact , no one there is able to learn the art , so far as my experience goes .
The North thinks it knows how to make corn bread , but this is gross superstition .
Perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as Southern corn bread , and perhaps no bread in the world is quite so bad as the Northern imitation of it .
In the North and in Europe hot bread is considered unhealthy .
Europe does not need ice-water , and does not drink it ; and yet , notwithstanding this , its word for it is better than ours , because it describes it , whereas ours does n't .
Europe calls it `` iced '' water .
That long-vanished day came vividly back to me a few weeks ago when , for the first time in twenty-one years , I found myself again amusing a child with smoke-charged soap-bubbles .
But he was not disturbed .

But at last , in 1888 , in Venice , my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C. , of Concord , Massachusetts , and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but death terminates .
The C. 's were very bright people and in every way charming and companionable .
They poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty attitude of the people who were present at that performance , and about the Boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the matter .
I tried to get it out of my mind , and let it die , and I succeeded .
Clinton was one of the dearest and loveliest human beings I have ever known , and we led a charmed existence together , in a contentment which knew no bounds .
He was a Scotchman , and a Presbyterian ; a Presbyterian of the old and genuine school , being honest and sincere in his religion , and loving it , and finding serenity and peace in it .
As soon as we comprehend that Cornelia Turner and the Italian lessons happened before the little six had been discovered to be grievances , we understand why Shelley 's happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death , and no one can persuade us into laying it on Harriet .

Our parents were well to do , there in Italy , and we were their only child .
The heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on him and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction .

I will not shoot him until after election .
I see a way to ruin them both before ; I will attend to that first .
Neither of them shall be elected , that I promise .
MONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death , and I found myself without an ambition .
But I was ashamed to go home .
I was in Cincinnati , and I set to work to map out a new career .
It was said that the expedition , owing to difficulties , had not thoroughly explored a part of the country lying about the head-waters , some four thousand miles from the mouth of the river .
It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to New Orleans , where I could doubtless get a ship .
I packed my valise , and took passage on an ancient tub called the 'Paul Jones , ' for New Orleans .
For the sum of sixteen dollars I had the scarred and tarnished splendors of 'her ' main saloon principally to myself , for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser travelers .
The steam began to whistle through the gauge-cocks .
'Just about twice as much more , as near as you can come at it . '
Mr. Bixby , unknown to me , of course , sent somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the leadsmen , another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers , and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could observe results .
Every moment or two a straggler was added to my audience ; and before I got to the head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my nose .

By winding-roads -- which were often cut to so great a depth between perpendicular walls that they were mere roofless tunnels -- we drove out a mile or two and visited the monument which stands upon the scene of the surrender of Vicksburg to General Grant by General Pemberton .
The battered remnant of the marble monument has been removed to the National Cemetery .

We supply most of the boats in the West ; there 's hardly a pound of butter on one of them .

I 've stopped in every town from Cincinnati to Natchez ; and I 've sent home big orders from every one of them . '
From Baton Rouge to New Orleans , the great sugar plantations border both sides of the river all the way , and stretch their league-wide levels back to the dim forest-walls of bearded cypress in the rear .
Plenty of dwellings all the way , on both banks -- standing so close together , for long distances , that the broad river lying between the two rows , becomes a sort of spacious street .
I was not sorry , for war talk by men who have been in a war is always interesting ; whereas moon talk by a poet who has not been in the moon is likely to be dull .
Nothing else is necessary .
But I came away from the theater that night disappointed and offended ; for I had had no glimpse of my hero , and his name was not in the bills .
I met him on the street the next morning , and before I could speak , he asked --
In regard to its publication , I can give no permission ; though if the names and places were omitted , and especially if sent out of the country , I think you might take the responsibility and do it .
Breakfast time approached while I mused these musings and called these ancient happenings back to mind ; so I got me back into the present and went down the hill .
He then laid aside his hunting-dress and accoutrements , and soon after both his feet began to turn black , so that he could not move .
The inflammation continued to increase , and had now reached his first rib ; and he said : 'Sister , my end is near .

One escapes from one breed of an ill only to encounter another breed of it .
The first officer has seen a man try to escape from his enemy by getting behind a tree ; but the enemy sent his boomerang sailing into the sky far above and beyond the tree ; then it turned , descended , and killed the man .
The Australian passenger has seen this thing done to two men , behind two trees -- and by the one arrow .
I arrived late at night and got up late in the morning .
All the corridors of the hotel were crowded with people waiting to get a glimpse of General Grant when he should pass to the place whence he was to review the great procession .
I stepped out on it , and saw below me millions of people blocking all the streets , and other millions caked together in all the windows and on all the house-tops around .
These masses took me for General Grant , and broke into volcanic explosions and cheers ; but it was a good place to see the procession , and I stayed .
Presently I heard the distant blare of military music , and far up the street I saw the procession come in sight , cleaving its way through the huzzaing multitudes , with Sheridan , the most martial figure of the War , riding at its head in the dress uniform of a Lieutenant-General .
He was superintendent of the Presbyterian Sunday-school .
It was but a humble distinction ; still , it was his only official one , and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its work and its interests .
The extreme kindliness of his nature was recognized by all ; in fact , people said that he was made entirely out of good impulses and bashfulness ; that he could always be counted upon for help when it was needed , and for bashfulness both when it was needed and when it was n't .
The short-voyage passenger gets his chief physical exercise out of `` horse-billiards '' -- shovel-board .
Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a child was born in the steerage , and now there is no way to tell which day it was born on .
The nurse thinks it was Sunday , the surgeon thinks it was Tuesday .
It will always be choosing first one and then the other , and will never be able to make up its mind permanently .
Every one in the ship says so .
And this is not all -- in fact , not the worst .
Truth is the most valuable thing we have .
Their pride in his lofty rank and ancient lineage lives on , in spite of his lost authority and the evil magic of his tailor .
He has no need to defile himself with work , or trouble his heart with the sordid cares of life ; the tribe will see to it that he shall not want , and that he shall hold up his head and live like a gentleman .
So he steered straight for the false opening , mistaking it for the true one .
There was no saving the ship .
The great seas swept her in and crushed her to splinters and rubbish upon the rock tushes at the base of the precipice .
Not one of all that fair and gracious company was ever seen again alive .
The tale is told to every stranger that passes the spot , and it will continue to be told to all that come , for generations ; but it will never grow old , custom can not stale it , the heart-break that is in it can never perish out of it .

`` What does your middle initial stand for , sir ? ''
On Saturdays the young men go out in their boats , and sometimes the water is fairly covered with the little sails .
The young fellows scramble aboard whole -- sometimes -- not always .
While I was in Sydney it was reported that a boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the Paramatta river and screamed for help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him from the assembling sharks ; but the sharks made swift work with the lives of both .
`` I saw the same man leap from the ground , and in going over he dipped his head , unaided by his hands , into a hat placed in an inverted position on the top of the head of another man sitting upright on horseback -- both man and horse being of the average size .
How could they stoop down and get it , with only two feet of space to stoop in ?
Still , they did manage those seeming impossibilities .

Those sad gums stood up out of the dry white clay , pictures of patience and resignation .
How this stuff had gotten into the pipe was a puzzle for some little time ; finally it was found that it had crept in through a crack that was almost invisible to the eye .
A gum tree forty feet away had tapped the pipe and was drinking the water .
But I am not representing him quite correctly .
When he was going , he turned and said :
With me sat my wife and daughter , and my manager , Mr. Carlyle Smythe .
I sat at the head of the table , and could see the right-hand wall ; the others had their backs to it .
On that wall , at a good distance away , were a couple of framed pictures .
I could not see them clearly , but from the groupings of the figures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III 's son by the Zulus in South Africa .
He was placed in that way so that one could get a right idea of his great dimensions .
I laid my cigar on the window-ledge ; chased my flighty thoughts a moment , then said in a placating manner :
Thuggee became known to the British authorities in India about 1810 , but its wide prevalence was not suspected ; it was not regarded as a serious matter , and no systematic measures were taken for its suppression until about 1830 .
About that time Major Sleeman captured Eugene Sue's Thug-chief , `` Feringhea , '' and got him to turn King 's evidence .
The revelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able to believe them .
The astonished government now took hold of Thuggee , and for ten years made systematic and relentless war upon it , and finally destroyed it .
Gang after gang was captured , tried , and punished .
`` The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from India , and known only in name , will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the East . ''
Very well , you say , but the explanation is not complete yet .
How did people come to drift into such a strange custom ?
Ordinary fire is forbidden ; there is no money in it .
I was told that this sacred fire is all furnished by one person , and that he has a monopoly of it and charges a good price for it .

At Jeypore , in Rajputana , we made a considerable stay .
We were not in the native city , but several miles from it , in the small European official suburb .
There were but few Europeans -- only fourteen but they were all kind and hospitable , and it amounted to being at home .

He knew that there were suspicions abroad in the Transvaal concerning him , but he expected to get through to Johannesburg before they should become general and obstructive .
Spinning along all day in the cars it was ecstasy to breathe the bracing air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the velvet plains , soft and lovely near by , still softer and lovelier further away , softest and loveliest of all in the remote distances , where dim island-hills seemed afloat , as in a sea -- a sea made of dream-stuff and flushed with colors faint and rich ; and dear me , the depth of the sky , and the beauty of the strange new cloud-forms , and the glory of the sunshine , the lavishness , the wastefulness of it !
It is also 17,000 feet high .
These figures may be relied upon .
I saw the club .
I saw and explored the beautiful sea-girt drives that wind about the mountains and through the paradise where the villas are : Also I saw some of the fine old Dutch mansions , pleasant homes of the early times , pleasant homes to-day , and enjoyed the privilege of their hospitalities .

He next tried brickbats .
Then he tried flint hatchets and other implements of Primeval Man , but by and by discovered that the factory where they were made was supplying other collectors as well as himself .
When his collection seemed at last perfect , a stuffed whale arrived from Greenland and an Aztec inscription from the Cundurango regions of Central America that made all former specimens insignificant .
A real Cundurango , as possibly you know , is a possession of such supreme value that , when once a collector gets it , he will rather part with his family than with it .
So my uncle sold out , and saw his darlings go forth , never more to return ; and his coal-black hair turned white as snow in a single night .
That would make you a hundred and eighty years old .

It was the calmest , coolest thing -- I never admired a man so much in my life .
The nail was lightly driven , its head painted , and game called .
The bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge off the nail-head ; the next man 's bullet drove the nail a little way into the target -- and removed all the paint .
He even failed to notice that the man who talks corrupt English six days in the week must and will talk it on the seventh , and ca n't help himself .
`` Arrived at sundown . ''
`` I will thank Mongrel for this .

This was joy unspeakable to me , but it made my wife as mad as if he had offered her a personal affront .
At this I thought my wife had a mind to show him the door .

And with tears in his eyes , this young man said , `` Oh , if I could only see him laugh once more !
I was profoundly moved .

He placed him in full view , in the second row of benches , that night , and I began on him .
It ended in a fight .
But I found out something to my advantage .
I was told that the Treasury Department was the proper place for me to go to .
`` Name of the Indian ? ''
The `` right man in the right place '' was then Secretary of War -- John B. Floyd , of peculiar renown !
They straight-way got an act passed transferring the Fisher matter from the dull Auditor to the ingenious Floyd .
He said , `` IT WAS PROVED that the Indians destroyed everything they could before the troops entered in pursuit . ''
He considered , therefore , that what they destroyed must have consisted of `` the houses with all their contents , and the liquor '' ( the most trifling part of the destruction , and set down at only $ 3,200 all told ) , and that the government troops then drove them off and calmly proceeded to destroy --
nothing can long remain a mystery to that august brain . ''
Night drew on apace , the sentinel crickets were posted , the Glow-Worm and Fire-Fly lamps were lighted , and the camp sank to silence and sleep .
After breakfast in the morning , the expedition moved on .
They could arrive at no decision .
There was nothing in the records of science that mentioned anything of this kind .

I thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty , but it looks different now .
All my misery vanished -- for a child might know that no harm could come with that benignant countenance .
My cheerful spirits returned at once , and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up brightly again .
Never a lonely outcast was so glad to welcome company as I was to greet the friendly giant .

One of Belfast 's local jokes was very good .
I said , `` Who is that man ? ''
But he got caught in a snow-drift in the cars , and like to have been starved to death .
He got so frost-bitten and frozen up generally , and used up for want of something to eat , that he was sick and out of his head two or three months afterward .
He is all right now , only he is a monomaniac , and when he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has eat up that whole car-load of people he talks about .
He has got their names as pat as A B C. When he gets them all eat up but himself , he always says : 'Then the hour for the usual election for breakfast having arrived , and there being no opposition , I was duly elected , after which , there being no objections offered , I resigned .
More : I had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to that day and date .

Is it because he has captured the takingest name ?
This prompt and all-competent stripe of prophet is always to be had in the market at ground-floor rates .
He does not stop to load , or consider , or take aim , but lets fly just as he stands .
And so , when he is asked why he considers a new movement a passing fad and quickly perishable , he finds himself unprepared with a reason and is more or less embarrassed .
Then he waylays the first spectre of a reason that goes flitting through the desert places of his mind , and is at once serene again and ready for conflict .
It furnishes some guessing-material of a sort which enables you to infer that it was `` we '' that suffered the mentioned injury , but if you should carry the language to a court you would not be able to prove that it necessarily meant that .
Each in his turn those little supernaturals of our by-gone ages and aeons joined the monster procession of his predecessors and marched horizonward , disappeared , and was forgotten .
No , there is nothing of that kind in Mrs. Eddy 's system .
In time this interest can grow into desire .
Mrs. Eddy knows that when you can not get a man to try -- free of cost -- a new and effective remedy for a disease he is afflicted with , you can generally sell it to him if you will put a price upon it which he can not afford .
When , in the beginning , she taught Christian Science gratis ( for good reasons ) , pupils were few and reluctant , and required persuasion ; it was when she raised the limit to three hundred dollars for a dollar 's worth that she could not find standing room for the invasion of pupils that followed .
It was out of powers approaching Mrs. Eddy 's -- though not equalling them -- that the Inquisition and the devastations of the Interdict grew .
That seems to be the meaning of the quoted passages .
They are always faithful to her , they never misinterpret her , they are a mirror which always reflects her exactly , precisely , minutely , unerringly , and always the same , to date , with only those progressive little natural changes in stature , dress , complexion , mood , and carriage that mark -- exteriorly -- the march of the years and record the accumulations of experience , while -- interiorly -- through all this steady drift of evolution the one essential detail , the commanding detail , the master detail of the make-up remains as it was in the beginning , suffers no change and can suffer none ; the basis of the character ; the temperament , the disposition , that indestructible iron framework upon which the character is built , and whose shape it must take , and keep , throughout life .
It is apparent , then , that in Christian Science it is not one man 's mind acting upon another man 's mind that heals ; that it is solely the Spirit of God that heals ; that the healer 's mind performs no office but to convey that force to the patient ; that it is merely the wire which carries the electric fluid , so to speak , and delivers the message .
She has a fine commercial ability , and could govern a vast railway system in great style ; she could draught a set of rules that Satan himself would say could not be improved on -- for devilish effectiveness -- by his staff ; but we know , by our excursions among the Mother-Church 's By-laws , that their English would discredit the deputy baggage-smasher .

There was a fine outburst of laughter , but as the justice was caught out himself , his reprimand was not very vigorous .
`` I do not see that there is anything the matter with you , '' the doctor answered , `` you may , of course , eat what you please . ''

It takes away his throne and makes him an outcast . ''
The talk rattled on in the gay and careless fashion privileged to youth , and we got the Paladin to map out his campaigns and fight his battles and win his victories and extinguish the English and put our King upon his throne and set his crown upon his head .
`` Yes , but I may not speak of that . ''
He had his steel cuirass on , and wore boots that came above his knees , and was equipped with a huge sword ; and when I looked at this martial figure , and heard the marvelous oaths , and guessed how little of poetry and sentiment might be looked for in this quarter , I hoped the little peasant-girl would not get the privilege of confronting this battery , but would have to content herself with the dictated letter .
This did not seem to trouble her in any way or wound her .
I whispered and said :

My grandfather had a cancer , and they never knew what was the matter with him till he died , and he did n't know himself .
All that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to cross my path , and out came the poem , and no more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog .

Everyone has read it , but in it there are expressions which not every one understands .
The most careful reading of the document will leave these impressions -- that is , unless one comprehends the past and present condition of foreign intercourse with China -- in which case it will be seen at once that there is no word in the treaty without a meaning , and no clause in it but was dictated by a present need or a wise policy looking to the future .
The first article of this new treaty reads as follows : ARTICLE I .
The English communities came to be looked upon as a part of England , and the American colonies as part of America ; and so , after the Trent affair , it was seriously held by many that the Confederate ships of war would be as justifiable in making attacks upon the American communities in China as they would be in attacking New York or Boston .
The municipal council which taxed these Chinamen was composed altogether of foreigners , so there was taxation without representation -- a policy which we fought seven years to overthrow .
The United States of America and His Majesty the Emperor of China , believing that the safety and prosperity of commerce will thereby best be promoted , agree that any privilege or immunity in respect to trade or navigation within the Chinese dominions which may not have been stipulated for by treaty , shall be subject to the discretion of the Chinese Government , and may be regulated by it accordingly , but not in a manner or spirit incompatible with the treaty stipulations of the parties .
At a first glance , this clause would seem unnecessary -- unnecessary because the granting of any privilege not stipulated in a treaty with China , must of course be a matter entirely subject to the pleasure of the Chinese Government .
There is in China a class of foreigners who demand privileges , concessions and immunities , instead of asking for them -- a class who look upon the Chinese as degraded barbarians , and not entitled to charity -- as helpless , and therefore to be trodden underfoot -- a tyrannical class who say openly that the Chinese should be forced to do thus and so ; that foreigners know what is best for them , better than they do themselves , and therefore it would be but a Christian kindness to take them by the throat and compel them to see their real interests as the enlightened foreigners see them .
These people harass and distress the Government by constantly dictating to it and meddling with its affairs .
I have seen at St. Peter 's , in Rome , a picture of certain restive Chinamen barbecuing some 80 Romish priests .
This was an uncalled for stretch of hospitality -- if it be proposed to call it hospitality at all .
As I have said , the Chinese were exceedingly hospitable and kind toward the first foreigners who came among them , 200 or 300 years ago .
They saw the doctrines of Christianity spreading far and wide over the land , yet nobody murmured against these things .
China 's confidence in the foreigners was not betrayed .
They began to cramp the privileges of converts ; they flouted the system of persuasion of the Jesuits , and adopted that of driving ; they meddled in politics , they became arrogant and dictatorial , they fomented discords everywhere -- in a word , they utterly destroyed Chinese confidence in foreigners , and raised up Chinese hatred and distrust against them .
I spoke , a while ago , of a domineering , hectoring class of foreigners in China who are always interfering with the Government's business , and thus keeping alive the distrust and dislike engendered by their kindred spirits , the Dominicans , an age ago .
I have seen troops of boys assault a Chinaman with stones when he was walking quietly along about his business , and send him bruised and bleeding home .
I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean , cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature , but I never saw a policeman interfere in the matter and I never saw a Chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done him .
It will be observed by Article 3 that the Chinese consuls will be placed upon the same footing as those from Russia and Great Britain , and that no mention is made of France .
The authorities got into trouble with a French consul in San Francisco , once , and , in order to pacify Napoleon , the United States enlarged the privileges of French consuls beyond those enjoyed by the consuls of all other countries .
Yet to China -- and afterward to the world at large -- it is perhaps the most important article in the whole treaty .
It aims at restoring Chinese confidence in foreigners , and will go far toward accomplishing it .
I have before spoken of an arrogant class of foreigners in China who demand of the Government the building of railways and telegraphs , and who assume to regulate and give law to the customs of trade , almost in open defiance of the constituted authorities .
Their menacing attitude and their threatening language frighten the Chinese , who know so well the resistless power of the Western nations .
They look upon these things with suspicion .
Even as it is now , foreigners can go into the interior and commit wrongs upon the people with impunity , for their `` extra territorial '' privileges leave them answerable only to their own laws , administered upon their own domain or `` concessions . ''
These `` concessions '' being far from the scene of the crime , it does not pay to send witnesses such distances , and so the wrong goes untried and unpunished .
There are other obstacles to the immediate construction of the demanded internal improvements -- among them the inherent prejudice of the untaught mass of the common people against innovation .
Unfortunately , the very day that the first message passed over the first telegraph erected in China , a man died of cholera at one end of the line .
We respect the griefs of the poor country people , but still the railways must be built .
They will tear heartstrings out by the roots , but they lead to the sources of unimaginable wealth , and they must be built .
These old prejudices must and can be eradicated -- just as they were in Massachusetts .
Hence , to all parties concerned , it is perhaps , the important clause of the treaty .
`` It 's a lie .
Judge Thatcher 's got it .
He said he 'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I did n't raise some money for him .
There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , I do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river .
The river looked miles and miles across .
You know what I mean -- I do n't know the words to put it in .
There was a little gray in the sky now ; so I stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast .
I told him I war n't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was .
The woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and I did n't feel a bit comfortable .
I could n't look up yet .
Well , it being away in the night and stormy , and all so mysterious-like , I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river .
I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there .
WELL , I catched my breath and most fainted .
So on we prowled again .
I could just barely see her .
One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and I thought I was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says :

We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .

If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , 'long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him .

`` Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you .
Well , I could n't HAVE it that way ; it would n't do at all .
So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage .

Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens .
And I peeped out , and in a little while Tom 's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth , you know .

You perceive that the question of who or what the Me is , is not a simple one at all .
You say `` I admire the rainbow , '' and `` I believe the world is round , '' and in these cases we find that the Me is not all speaking , but only the MENTAL part .
You say , `` I grieve , '' and again the Me is not all speaking , but only the MORAL part .
The intellect and the feelings can act quite INDEPENDENTLY of each other ; we recognize that , and we look around for a Ruler who is master over both , and can serve as a DEFINITE AND INDISPUTABLE `` I , '' and enable us to know what we mean and who or what we are talking about when we use that pronoun , but we have to give it up and confess that we can not find him .

The delight that was in my heart showed in my face , and the man saw it and was pleased ; saw it so plainly that he answered it as if it had been spoken .

When he wanted candy and could not have it , he listened to reason , and contented himself without it .
He did not drink a drop for two months , and meantime was the pet of the good .
Then he fell -- in the gutter ; and there was general sorrow and lamentation .
An account of this , also , was published , and the town was drowned in happy tears over the re-restoration of the poor beast and struggling victim of the fatal bowl .
Everybody wrung the hand of the new convert when the meeting was over ; his salary was enlarged next day ; he was the talk of the town , and its hero .

It is better and more becoming to intimate that you will do as she bids you , and then afterward act quietly in the matter according to the dictates of your best judgment .
It is not on account of his brightness that I love him -- no , it is not that .
He is not to blame for his brightness , such as it is , for he did not make it himself ; he is as God make him , and that is sufficient .

When time was called , Isaac let on to be comfortable and indifferent ; told the other team to take the first innings .

There is no house outside the wall on the whole hill , or any vestige of a former house ; all the houses are inside the wall , but there is n't room for another one .
It is really a finished town , and has been finished a very long time .
There is no space between the wall and the first circle of buildings ; no , the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first circle of buildings , and the roofs jut a little over the wall and thus furnish it with eaves .
The general level of the massed roofs is gracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined castle and the tall spires of a couple of churches ; so , from a distance Dilsberg has rather more the look of a king 's crown than a cap .

It was on our right , across the narrow head of the valley .
Suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard ; there would be nothing for him to seize ; nothing could keep him from rolling ; five revolutions would bring him to the edge , and over he would go .
We were eight in number -- Croz ( guide ) , old Peter Taugwalder ( guide ) and his two sons ; Lord F. Douglas , Mr. Hadow , Rev .
The youngest Taugwalder fell to my share .
The wine-bags also fell to my lot to carry , and throughout the day , after each drink , I replenished them secretly with water , so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before !
Three adventurous English gentlemen , [ 1 ] of great experience in mountain-climbing , made up their minds to ascend Mont Blanc without guides or porters .
All endeavors to dissuade them from their project failed .
How these men could fall two thousand feet , almost perpendicularly , and live afterward , is a most strange and unaccountable thing .
Betimes , next morning , we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the sea .
On the door of the cabin was a sign , in French , to the effect that `` One may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes . ''
I think we do keep up the death statistics accurately ; and if we do , our cities are healthier than the cities of Europe .
I scrap-booked these reports during several months , and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death-rate month after month .
These tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000 population for a year .
One does not see it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to , for there the law says , in effect , `` It is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong . ''
At least so everybody says -- but I saw something which caused me to doubt ; I saw a horseman run over an old woman one day -- the police arrested him and took him away .

Whenever one sees in a book or in a king's proclamation those words `` the nation , '' they bring before us the upper classes ; only those ; we know no other `` nation '' ; for us and the kings no other `` nation '' exists .
Yes , she kissed those poor things over and over again , as if they had been something costly and wonderful ; and she pinned the Virgin on her doublet , and sent for her helmet and tied the ribbon on that ; first one way , then another ; then a new way , then another new way ; and with each effort perching the helmet on her hand and holding it off this way and that , and canting her head to one side and then the other , examining the effect , as a bird does when it has got a new bug .
`` Would it be courteous , your Excellency , to move abruptly from here without waiting for an answer from the Duke of Burgundy ?

The Chancellor spoke up with a fine irony in his manner :
By the laws of war she could not be denied the privilege of ransom .
She was not a rebel ; she was a legitimately constituted soldier , head of the armies of France by her King 's appointment , and guilty of no crime known to military law ; therefore she could not be detained upon any pretext , if ransom were proffered .
As a soldier , her record was spotless .
A subterfuge must be found , and , as we have seen , was found .
`` I was thirteen when I first heard a Voice coming from God to help me to live well .
Manchon and several of the judges who had been members of our court were among the witnesses who appeared before that Tribunal of Rehabilitation .
Recalling these miserable proceedings which I have been telling you about , Manchon testified thus : -- here you have it , all in fair print in the unofficial history :
`` Where did you get it ? ''
So that trail was not worth following .
`` Most dear God , in honor of your holy passion I beseech you , if you love me , that you will reveal to me what I am to answer to these churchmen .
As concerns my dress , I know by what command I have put it on , but I know not in what manner I am to lay it off .
THE BRILLIANT weather , the heavenly weather , the bewitching weather made everybody 's heart to sing , as I have told you ; yes , Rouen was feeling light-hearted and gay , and most willing and ready to break out and laugh upon the least occasion ; and so when the news went around that the young girl in the tower had scored another defeat against Bishop Cauchon there was abundant laughter -- abundant laughter among the citizens of both parties , for they all hated the Bishop .
It is true , the English-hearted majority of the people wanted Joan burned , but that did not keep them from laughing at the man they hated .
It would have been perilous for anybody to laugh at the English chiefs or at the majority of Cauchon's assistant judges , but to laugh at Cauchon or D'Estivet and Loyseleur was safe -- nobody would report it .
`` Nevertheless , you have abjured , and have especially promised to return no more to the dress of a man . ''
`` Yes , my poor child .
`` That 's a mighty curious thing , '' he says .
`` I do n't understand it . ''
`` Who tole him he could ? ''
I do n't know what he meant by that , and he did n't say ; it was just one of his irrulevances , I reckon -- he was full of them , sometimes , when he was in a close place and could n't see no other way out -- but I didn't mind .
