said she , when the door was shut .
She told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous .
`` I do not believe a word of it , my dear .
If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long .
The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her :
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .
`` This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .
`` No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ''
`` I had much rather go in the coach . ''
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .
For my part , Mr. Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up very differently .
It is a pity they are not handsome !
Not that I think Charlotte so _very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend . ''
I write rather slowly . ''
`` I am afraid you do not like your pen .
`` Your humility , Mr. Bingley , '' said Elizabeth , `` must disarm reproof . ''
Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and at another word , might stay a month . ''
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ''
Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte ; and , after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ''
`` It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ''
`` The person of whom I speak is a gentleman , and a stranger . ''
`` Though it is difficult , '' said Jane , `` to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ''
`` In point of composition , '' said Mary , `` the letter does not seem defective .
Then turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
`` About a month , '' said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , `` He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . ''
How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?
How can they suit each other ?
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent .
_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Do not wish me such an evil . ''
`` May I ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
It was really a very handsome thought .
`` Yes , or I will never see her again . ''
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion .
The strangeness of Mr. Collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .
`` Your first position is false .
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .
`` It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , '' said she .
`` We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . ''
`` But my dear Elizabeth , '' she added , `` what sort of girl is Miss King ?
`` Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . ''
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales , and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving .
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage ; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it , and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .
`` I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ''
`` These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .
`` From the very beginning -- from the first moment , I may almost say -- of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
This can not be !
`` How despicably I have acted ! ''
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .
`` But , '' he added , `` you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ''
`` Wickham so very bad !
It is almost past belief .
And poor Mr. Darcy !
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .
`` A great deal of good management , depend upon it .
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income .
Well , much good may it do them !
`` You , who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right .
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .
Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit -- of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .
But nothing can be done -- I know very well that nothing can be done .
I have not the smallest hope .
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development .
While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible .
But now it was all too natural .
For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?
His temptation is not adequate to the risk ! ''
`` Well , then -- supposing them to be in London .
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London than in Scotland . ''
`` This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of .
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him ; it told them that , on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street ; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .
He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon .
`` That is very true , '' said Elizabeth ; `` though it had not occurred to me before .
A small sum could not do all this . ''
`` Their conduct has been such , '' replied Elizabeth , `` as neither you , nor I , nor anybody can ever forget .
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her : `` Mrs. Bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .
`` Well , mamma , '' said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , `` and what do you think of my husband ?
I only hope they may have half my good luck .
Must it be so ? ''
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .
`` There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town .
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham .
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia 's flight on her own folly alone .
He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her .
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her -- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .
She was ashamed to think how much .
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing , to him .
said he , as he joined her .
`` Yes , she did . ''
`` He is as fine a fellow , '' said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , `` as ever I saw .
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law . ''
`` Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , '' ( for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news ) .
`` Well , so much the better .
Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything .
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .
People _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true .
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
`` Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , '' said she , `` did he come at all ? ''
`` Oh , Jane , take care . ''
When the tea-things were removed , and the card-tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
He came , and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed .
In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter 's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out :
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
My dear Mr. Bennet , '' cried his wife , `` what are you talking of ?
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . ''
Then addressing her daughter , `` Oh !
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !
I am sure I sha n't get a wink of sleep all night .
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .
`` Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .
`` 'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Mr. Collins moreover adds , 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
That is his notion of Christian forgiveness !
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ''
But it is so strange ! ''
`` No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . ''
`` But I was embarrassed . ''
In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman 's days were comfortably spent .
The son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age .
By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth .
The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure .
He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; -- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest .
He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters .
Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable .
-- `` Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome !
It would be enough to make them completely easy .
he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . ''
No sooner was his father 's funeral over , than Mrs. John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law , arrived with her child and their attendants .
So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother .
Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .
Marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor 's .
The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .
Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished .
Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself .
She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .
CHAPTER 2 Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors .
How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ?
He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing .
`` Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen .
`` No taste for drawing ! ''
replied Elinor , `` why should you think so ?
Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well .
The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill .
The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance .
They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .
Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .
Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person .
His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? ''
I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature .
`` I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . ''
Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure .
Her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight .
From Willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created .
`` There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for .
Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . ''
`` You are mistaken , Elinor , '' said she warmly , `` in supposing I know very little of Willoughby .
she cried , `` I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne .
`` But indeed this is quite another thing .
The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years .
They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure .
`` No , indeed , it is not . ''
He then took leave of the whole party .
His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year ; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal , and he had himself often complained of his poverty .
But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged , and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne .
Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . ''
But Mrs. Smith must be obliged ; -- and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . ''
Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise .
Mrs. Dashwood first spoke .
Elinor 's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 's .
`` Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened .
Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ?
To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ?
`` I confess , '' replied Elinor , `` that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . ''
`` It is a beautiful country , '' he replied ; `` but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . ''
Greatness will not make me so . ''
`` Strange that it would ! ''
YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting .
Your ideas are only more noble than mine .
`` No , Marianne , never .
I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? ''
`` I am convinced , '' said Edward , `` that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel .
But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess .
I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles .
`` I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , '' she cried .
`` What do you mean ? ''
I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am !
Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is !
How I should like such a house for myself !
Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park .
Mrs. Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased .
They attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good .
Marianne looked very grave and said nothing .
`` And what did the Colonel say ? ''
`` I am flattered by his commendation .
But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . ''
-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy .
`` I confess , '' replied Elinor , `` that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . ''
Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate .
Did you think he came directly from town ? ''
`` And yet I do assure you , '' replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , `` there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable .
But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me .
I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it .
Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you .
We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters .
Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves .
When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music !
It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London .
Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue .
This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt .
Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks .
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day .
This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation .
She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out .
Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ?
This is not the place for explanations .
She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past .
Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt .
Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her .
how can you talk so ?
Do n't we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ?
`` Bond Street , January .
No positive engagement indeed !
In the drawing-room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings , with a wine-glass , full of something , in her hand .
`` You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . ''
The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits .
I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt .
Hers , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate .
Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered .
And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian .
My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her .
The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us .
This however was not the case .
She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned .
The shock which her marriage had given me , '' he continued , in a voice of great agitation , `` was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce .
He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room .
`` Oh , yes , I dare say you will . ''
After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister 's entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour .
Fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister 's audacity .
Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne 's warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon 's eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point .
Marianne 's feelings did not stop here .
She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor 's shoulder , she burst into tears .
-- Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her .
But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else .
`` You reside in Devonshire , I think , '' -- was his next observation , `` in a cottage near Dawlish . ''
But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither .
The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , --
Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place .
here come the Richardsons .
I assure you they are very genteel people .
The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from Lucy herself .
It was as follows :
When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .
`` No , I can not go to Cleveland . ''
I understand that he intends to take orders .
Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.
Pray assure him of it . ''
`` You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , '' said Elinor , with a faint smile .
Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend .
-- I understand you .
Mr. Ferrars is to be the man .
Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you .
`` Mrs. Jennings told me , '' said he , `` that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again .
-- And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? ''
-- And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him .
`` I am not sorry to see you alone , '' he replied , `` for I have a good deal to say to you .
It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford ; -- a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there .
A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind .
The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage .
It was a night of almost equal suffering to both .
Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying ,
Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention .
`` When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , '' said she , `` we will take long walks together every day .
I know the summer will pass happily away .
I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading .
But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon .
`` Do you compare your conduct with his ? ''
-- The future must be my proof .
You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you .
But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . ''
And why does he regret it ?
But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ?
He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing .
He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . ''
`` No , ma'am , only they two . ''
Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed .
Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more .
Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
`` Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs. -- Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars . ''
His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful .
He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ; -- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before .
Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest .
-- He thus continued :
The whole of Lucy 's behaviour in the affair , and the prosperity which crowned it , therefore , may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest , an unceasing attention to self-interest , however its progress may be apparently obstructed , will do in securing every advantage of fortune , with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience .
He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent .
Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all .
-- and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married , -- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat !
Can you not conceive the Luxury of living in every distress that Poverty can inflict , with the object of your tenderest affection ? ''
On hearing her announced by the Name of `` Lady Dorothea , '' I instantly quitted my Post and followed her into the Parlour , for I well remembered that she was the Lady , proposed as a Wife for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet .
A grove of full-grown Elms sheltered us from the East -- .
Regardless however of anything concerning them , I gave myself up to my own sad Reflections .
At length , returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel who had so violently disturbed my feelings .
Great as was my astonishment , it was yet increased , when on looking out of Windows , I beheld the Husband of Philippa , with Philippa by his side , on the Coachbox and when on looking behind I beheld , Philander and Gustavus in the Basket .

-- but I beg your pardon -- I had entirely forgotten to whom I was speaking -- ''
`` I can scarcely beleive you to be serious ( returned he ) when you speak of their persons in so extroidinary a Manner .
( said I , with the greatest complacency , for I assure you my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho ' by what followed , one would suppose that William was conscious of having given me just cause to be so , for coming up to me and taking my hand , he said ) `` You must not look so grave Susan ; you will make me fear I have offended you ! ''
I never shall forget the very witty answer I made to this speech .
`` Eloisa ( said I ) I beg you would be quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future , for be assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own pursuits and never extend it to yours . ''
He afterwards married the King 's daughter Catherine , a very agreable woman by Shakespear's account .
In spite of all this however he died , and was succeeded by his son Henry .
This Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of York , by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right inferior to hers , tho ' he pretended to the contrary .
My Freinds are all alarmed for me ; They fear my declining health ; they lament my want of spirits ; they dread the effects of both .
In hopes of releiving my melancholy , by directing my thoughts to other objects , they have invited several of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us .
`` Indeed Ma'am I have no such intention -- ''
She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady Greville , or you may be certain that I would never enter either her House , or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of being abused for my Poverty while I am in them.
I had not been long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard , but just as we were going to stand up , he recollected that his Servant had got his white Gloves , and immediately ran out to fetch them .
`` Well , I give you Joy of your conquest , replied Lady Scudamore , and I beleive it to have been a very complete one ; I am sure it is not a contemptible one , for my Cousin is a charming young fellow , has seen a great deal of the World , and writes the best Love-letters I ever read . ''
`` Oh Lady Scudamore , said I wiping my eyes , that such a sweet Creature should talk of dieing ! ''
`` When I am dead said he , let me be carried and lain at her feet , and perhaps she may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains . ''

This daring Action was suggested to him by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet for him , provided he would take a small house near the borders of an extensive Forest , and about three Miles from the Sea .
Wilhelminus gladly accepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a retreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by reading this advertisement in a Newspaper .
I have great hope of prevailing .
We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . ''
certainly , '' was his daughter 's ; but Sir Walter 's remark was , soon afterwards --
One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top .
cried Sir Basil , 'it is Admiral Baldwin .
What do you take his age to be ? '
Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin .
She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell 's motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft 's really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short-lived engagement .
Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , `` I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton .
-- reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal .
`` Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good .
It is early . ''
I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . ''
As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple .
`` I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , '' was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary 's reproach of `` Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , '' she never had the smallest temptation to say , `` Very true . ''
Mary 's declaration was , `` I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . ''
Miss Anne , I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children .
But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt !
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; `` do n't do this , '' and `` do n't do that ; '' or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . ''
In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person 's , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own .
That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage .
Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .
`` Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match .
Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking .
Poor Harville , sister !
He had a wife .
`` If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters . ''
While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared .
The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas .
She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children .
She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain .
Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly .
She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings .
She could not stay .
It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four -- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it .
It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth .
`` And so , I made her go .
`` Do you mean that she refused him ? ''
I can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever .
After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment .
She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well-looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant .
Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea .
The tone , the look , with which `` Thank God ! ''
`` Uppercross , the necessity of some one 's going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time . ''
But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .
Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly .
Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .
Here was a great deal to soften the business .
said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour .
`` The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . ''
Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter 's at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch .
How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant .
She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman .
`` Yes , '' sighed Anne , `` we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! ''
She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing .
Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust .
They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .
Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .
She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend .
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .
She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way .
As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began --
He was courting her week after week .
But even then there was something odd in their way of going on .
We have seen nothing of him since November .
This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , `` I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy .
It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence .
I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man . ''
`` No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that .
I think we must get him to Bath .
Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay .
It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
Anne named them all .
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground .
Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in .
He might have been in Mr Elliot 's company , but she had not courage to ask the question .
When she could give another glance , he had moved away .
It was the only intelligible motive .
Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection !
How was such jealousy to be quieted ?
`` The little Durands were there , I conclude , '' said she , `` with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed .
`` Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . ''
I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now .
He is no hypocrite now .
He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken : he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others .
He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .
She had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect .
`` True , '' said Anne , `` very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ?
It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .
No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives .
All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . ''
And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . ''
I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match-making . ''
They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .
Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_ .
`` In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's .
They have more gentleness .
I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be .
`` Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . ''
`` Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding .
-- You know you could not . ''
`` I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
`` Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me .
Do you think I am right ? ''
That would have been too dreadful !
-- What an escape !
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
`` I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . ''
`` I have reason to think , '' he replied , `` that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter : -- Robert Martin is the man .
Her visit to Abbey-Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .
Harriet 's cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton .
Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye !
She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , `` Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed .
I give you credit for it .
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . ''
Trust to me . ''
`` We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here . ''
`` Yes , my dear , if there is time.
There will not be time for any thing . ''
I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ? ''
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father .
The children are all fond of him . ''
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . ''
I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed .
-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor . ''
And how tired you must be after your journey !
You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.
I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
`` But why should you be sorry , sir ?
-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . ''
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls .
Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her .
-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : `` for I can not depend upon his coming .
I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .
Have not I some right to complain ?
`` You had better order the carriage directly , my love , '' said she ; `` I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
I should not mind walking half the way .
Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . ''
that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance .
I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more .
no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer . ''
Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .
`` There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done .
I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion .
And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , 'I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , 'But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized .
Do let me hear what she says . '
`` Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . ''
If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone .
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , `` She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! ''
Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
`` I am happy you approved , '' said Emma , smiling ; `` but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . ''
An arch look expressed -- '' I understand you well enough ; '' but she said only , `` Miss Fairfax is reserved . ''
Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! ''
As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .
-- '' And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !
-- but they always dealt at Ford 's -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !
I thought I should have fainted .
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door !
I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.
dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- ( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ? )
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !
Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . ''
The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride .
She had talked her into love ; but , alas !
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
And now , poor girl !
When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , `` Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? ''
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.
There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .
Mrs. Weston , kind-hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine 's countenance .
yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?
`` They walked , I conclude .
See the consequence of keeping you company !
-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?
I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . ''
`` My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax -- ''
They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ; -- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .
`` I have not been working uninterruptedly , '' he replied , `` I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . ''
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
`` But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . ''
Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . ''
`` My dear , you are too particular , '' said her husband .
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
It was a sad change .
It had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days .
`` Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into .
`` When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield .
`` But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ? ''
Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again , -- self-important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill-bred .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton 's consequence only could surpass .
He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .
`` Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . ''
-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
In a moment he went on --
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . ''
Her Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
`` This is very true , '' said she , `` at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.
-- She will never like me now .
I have neglected her too long .
`` My dear Jane , say no more about it .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves .
But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out .
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ''
`` Excuse me , '' said Jane earnestly , `` I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant .
I have a note of his.
said she , `` I get quite anxious about you .
`` But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .
Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ; -- that is -- I do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ; -- yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ; -- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . ''
The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them .
Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !
-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .
`` Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
-- Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town .
They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .
Have you finished it ?
Has Emma read it all ?
Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now .
I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . ''
`` That is very likely .
Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs. Elton 's beginning to talk to him .
Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , `` How do you like my gown ?
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.
-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.
-- We shall see if our styles suit.
I like him very well . ''
`` She will think Frank ought to ask her . ''
In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent .
The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them .
This was the amount of the whole story , -- of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.
`` My poor dear Harriet !
-- Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired .
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . ''
`` Why , to own the truth , '' cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , `` if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days .
Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ?
I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
It used to stand here .
This is a sort of dull-looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer .
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
I want to puzzle you again . ''
It is time for us to be going indeed .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .
This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again : -- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party !
Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston 's temper .
It was now the middle of June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty .
It is my party .
I will invite your guests . ''
I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm .
Here , -- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
And Jane will have such another .
There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ; -- and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know .
Every thing as natural and simple as possible .
Is not that your idea ? ''
The heat even would be danger.
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .
`` Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . ''
Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .
She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .
But ( lowering her voice ) -- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . ''
Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . ''
you will never guess .
You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.
-- Do you understand ? ''
As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .
She never had been so depressed .
Happily it was not necessary to speak .
`` It must be a severe trial to them all .
There was no bearing such an `` always ; '' and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --
`` Yes , our good Mrs. Elton .
She would not take a denial .
-- but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .
-- Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.
Mrs. Smallridge , a most delightful woman !
Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !
-- And her salary !
-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse .
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame .
She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill .
At least , however , I can not be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible -- ''
A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart .
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .
It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself !
`` I never should have presumed to think of it at first , '' said she , `` but for you .
You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have .
But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . ''
-- How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !
was not that her own doing too ?
Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself ?
-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .
-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.
-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
She had herself been first with him for many years past .
-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ .
-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates !
-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_.
-- Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .
Nothing should separate her from her father .
One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , '' she said , `` was that of making her _unreasonable_ .
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .
such delightful proofs of Hartfield 's attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over .
-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
`` I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . ''
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . ''
They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible .
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying ,
`` Yours ever , `` A. W . ''
-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill. -- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
Come , he knows himself there .
-- Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they ?
That was your name for him , was it ? ''
You must get his consent before you ask mine . ''
-- He will have a hot walk . ''
-- I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . ''
-- '' I do believe , '' she continued , `` this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
It will be the only difference . ''
Emma laughed , and replied : `` But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people .
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . ''
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.
Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .
-- '' Well ! ''
How , where , when ?
`` Do you dare say this ? ''
-- What do you deserve ? ''
He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . ''
The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .
no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
I was the most miserable wretch ! ''
`` Aye , so we do .
That is very disagreeable .
She was looked at , however , and with some admiration ; for , in her own hearing , two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl .
They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen : `` My dear Catherine , '' said she , `` do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . ''
It is but just one .
Catherine coloured , and disclaimed again .
Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else .
I can perfectly comprehend your feelings . ''
What do you mean ? ''
Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine 's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men .
`` Yes , that 's the book ; such unnatural stuff !
An old man playing at see-saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . ''
Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence .
`` I am glad of it .
Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer .
The others walked away , John Thorpe was still in view , and she gave herself up for lost .
With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request , and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set , may be easily imagined .
He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me .
`` Then I am quite at a loss .
One thing , however , I must observe .
Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return , or if any other gentleman were to address you , there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose ? ''
`` And is that to be my only security ?
Alas , alas ! ''
'For six weeks , I allow Bath is pleasant enough ; but beyond that , it is the most tiresome place in the world . '
But I , who live in a small retired village in the country , can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home ; for here are a variety of amusements , a variety of things to be seen and done all day long , which I can know nothing of there . ''
He was a very handsome man , of a commanding aspect , past the bloom , but not past the vigour of life ; and with his eye still directed towards her , she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper .
But while she did so , the gentleman retreated , and her partner , coming nearer , said , `` I see that you guess what I have just been asked .
That gentleman knows your name , and you have a right to know his .
In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded , a new source of felicity arose to her .
She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath .
`` I shall like it , '' she cried , `` beyond anything in the world ; and do not let us put it off -- let us go tomorrow . ''
Of her other , her older , her more established friend , Isabella , of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight's experience , she scarcely saw anything during the evening .
`` I thought how it would be , '' said Mrs. Allen .
`` Anybody would have thought so indeed .
I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . ''
`` The oldest in the kingdom . ''
`` Not they indeed , '' cried Thorpe ; `` for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them -- does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? ''
`` Yes , I know he does ; I saw him .
`` Yes , yes , every hole and corner . ''
`` Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ''
But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names .
She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly .
She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved .
Isabella then tried another method .
She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself .
`` I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively !
When once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them .
These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . ''
Catherine found that John Thorpe had given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it .
But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing .
I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ''
`` I wish I were too .
The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all -- it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention .
The speeches that are put into the heroes ' mouths , their thoughts and designs -- the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ''
They display imagination without raising interest .
In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one 's own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such .
Catherine assented -- and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady's merits closed the subject .
She knew nothing of drawing -- nothing of taste : and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit , for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her .
The little which she could understand , however , appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before .
You talked of expected horrors in London -- and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George 's Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window .
Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe .
There are some charming little villas about Richmond . ''
Who knows when we may be together again ?
Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . ''
There are very few people I am sorry to see .
Company is always cheerful . ''
Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother , Captain Tilney , was expected almost every hour , she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking , handsome young man , whom she had never seen before , and who now evidently belonged to their party .
`` I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ''
The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , `` Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ''
`` My heart , indeed !
You men have none of you any hearts . ''
I hope this pleases you '' ( turning her back on him ) ; `` I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ''
After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , `` Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ''
Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . ''
`` Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey !
We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire -- nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture .
While they snugly repair to their own end of the house , she is formally conducted by Dorothy , the ancient housekeeper , up a different staircase , and along many gloomy passages , into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before .
Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber -- too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size -- its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ?
Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room .
In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear .
With a curiosity so justly awakened , and feelings in every way so agitated , repose must be absolutely impossible .
What could it contain ?
Till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun 's first rays she was determined to peruse it .
She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper .
By accident or argument ? ''
`` Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how .
Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ''
She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn .
He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition .
Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion .
An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again .
Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it .
It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike .
It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question .
Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were .
Astonishment and doubt first seized them ; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame .
But a faithful promise -- the fidelity of promising !
Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began .
He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father's entrance .
The general , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible .
As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again .
She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her .
`` It contained something worse than anybody could suppose !
You will soon know why . ''
Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected .
Catherine 's mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the general for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting .
`` I have very little to say for Frederick 's motives , such as I believe them to have been .
He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself .
If the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ''
What can be the matter ? ''
it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him .
The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life .
It was there , it was on that day , that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard -- had he even confused her by his too significant reference !
Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine 's heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet -- !
`` Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , '' said she .
On the strength of this , the general , soon after Eleanor 's marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting , it will not appear , after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general 's cruelty , that they were essentially hurt by it .
MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
My dearest Friend , -- I write in the greatest distress ; the most unfortunate event has just taken place .
Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my power , nor accuse me of instability without first hearing my reasons .
We have been unguarded in forming this hasty engagement , but we must not complete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason to fear the connection would be opposed by those friends on whom you depend .
I have now been but a few months a widow , and , however little indebted to my husband 's memory for any happiness derived from him during a union of some years , I can not forget that the indelicacy of so early a second marriage must subject me to the censure of the world , and incur , what would be still more insupportable , the displeasure of Mr. Vernon .
I might perhaps harden myself in time against the injustice of general reproach , but the loss of HIS valued esteem I am , as you well know , ill-fitted to endure ; and when to this may be added the consciousness of having injured you with your family , how am I to support myself ?
We must not meet .
Cruel as this sentence may appear , the necessity of pronouncing it , which can alone reconcile it to myself , will be evident to you when you have considered our situation in the light in which I have found myself imperiously obliged to place it .
Again , therefore , I say that we ought not , we must not , yet meet .
Let me hear from you soon -- very soon .
Mrs. Mainwaring had that instant entered the house , and forced herself into her guardian 's presence , though I did not know a syllable of it till afterwards , for I was out when both she and Reginald came , or I should have sent him away at all events ; but she was shut up with Mr. Johnson , while he waited in the drawing-room for me .
She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her husband , but perhaps you know this already from himself .
That detestable Mrs. Mainwaring , who , for your comfort , has fretted herself thinner and uglier than ever , is still here , and they have been all closeted together .
What can be done ?
The grandeur of the house astonished , but could not console her .
The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day 's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep .
But Tom 's extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder .
`` I must say it , and say it with pleasure .
Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now .
`` I pay very little regard , '' said Mrs. Grant , `` to what any young person says on the subject of marriage .
If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . ''
It will do just as well .
In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford 's beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _him_ .
`` Pray , is she out , or is she not ?
She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _out_ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _is_ . ''
Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ''
To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing-closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all .
As for Dr. Grant 's bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _his_ way ; and my brother-in-law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . ''
Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ''
The second day 's trial was not so guiltless .
Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared .
I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ''
When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day .
There were many other views to be shewn ; and though the weather was hot , there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go .
Everything answered ; it was all gaiety and good-humour , the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure -- till the fourth day , when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded .
Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _she_ was excluded .
As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert .
It was as much as I could bear myself .
Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in .
`` You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , '' cried Mrs. Norris ; `` but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton .
very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . ''
Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence , and stepping forward to Maria , said , in a voice which she only could hear , `` I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . ''
`` Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ''
And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother , and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover , while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place .
`` Query , '' said Mr. Crawford , looking round him , `` whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ?
I see walls of great promise .
Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ''
`` How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week !
I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ''
Fanny 's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ''
After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again .
I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary .
I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ''
Edmund left the seat likewise .
Another summer will hardly improve it to me . ''
I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ' drive . ''
Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good-humour of success , she said , `` Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good-bye . ''
On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace , Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top , just ready for the wilderness , at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house .
Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster .
Whatever cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia 's leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson 's illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .
Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , `` I think _you_ have done pretty well yourself , ma'am .
Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses .
I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with .
She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns .
Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . ''
No ; for you certainly would not know what to say .
It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours .
It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing . ''
`` Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . ''
`` Oh dear , no , ma'am , nobody suspected you !
Well , Edmund , '' he continued , returning to the former subject , posture , and voice , as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again , `` but _this_ I _will_ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ''
Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed .
Other preparations were also in hand .
An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton , and been cut out by Mrs. Norris ( with a saving by her good management of full three-quarters of a yard ) , and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids , and still the play was wanting ; and as two or three days passed away in this manner , Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found .
Edmund could not answer him .
If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is .
In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ''
`` _The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches , '' returned Mr. Rushworth , `` which is no trifle . ''
`` Your _brother_ should take the part , '' said Mr. Yates , in a low voice .
`` It is not at all what I like , '' he continued .
`` Yes , it will be a great point . ''
`` No , she is quite determined .
She certainly will not act . ''
She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others .
`` You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth .
It may do _her_ some good .
I often think of Mr. Rushworth 's property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him .
A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ''
Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ?
She had known it would irritate and distress her ; she had known it her duty to keep away .
The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue .
But Mr. Yates , having never been with those who thought much of parental claims , or family confidence , could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary ; and therefore , thanking them , said , `` he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away . ''
Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister .
Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth 's pink satin cloak as her brother-in-law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return .
Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing-room .
Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence .
Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came -- he would rather wait for tea .
Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup .
`` Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea .
Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room ; and on casting his eye round it , to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture .
He was anxious , while vindicating himself , to say nothing unkind of the others : but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation .
Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent .
_Her_ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last .
You will find Fanny everything you could wish . ''
I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies .
You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . ''
Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford 's resources -- her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome .
Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams ' going away -- an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford 's desire of something new , and which had little reality in Fanny 's feelings .
`` It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this .
Not too much attempted ! ''
`` I grant you the name is good in itself , and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas .
Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . ''
`` By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that .
Be honest and poor , by all means -- but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you .
No , Miss Crawford , '' he added , in a more serious tone , `` there _are_ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance -- absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining -- but they are of a different character . ''
The two cousins walked home together ; and , except in the immediate discussion of this engagement , which Edmund spoke of with the warmest satisfaction , as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with so much pleasure established , it was a silent walk ; for having finished that subject , he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any other .
`` I do not know .
`` But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ''
And Julia is with them . ''
Sir Thomas , after a moment 's thought , recommended speculation .
He was a whist player himself , and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner .
Fanny 's last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford 's quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention .
Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the `` no '' and the `` yes '' had been very recently in alternation .
But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled , within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment , when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her .
Was there not a `` yes '' in all this ?
`` My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much .
Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle 's accustomary late dinner-hour , and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral 's .
The Admiral , he believed , had interest .
As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room .
`` Suppose I were to find him there again to-day ! ''
`` Dearest Fanny ! ''
But it is unnecessary here .
No such time as you allude to will ever come .
This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia 's return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time .
A great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas 's side , tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement .
`` He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . ''
`` I know nothing of the Miss Owens , '' said Fanny calmly .
Miss Crawford turned her eye on her , as if wanting to hear or see more , and then laughingly said , `` Oh yes !
But I am not fishing ; do n't compliment me .
Miss Crawford 's uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation , and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather , had they been put to the proof ; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite , or more than quite , his usual cheerfulness , she had nothing farther to try her own .
His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety ; a day before it might have irritated , but now it was a pleasant joke -- suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself .
he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny .
But this he stoutly denied .
He had often seen it tried .
Her affections were evidently strong .
Then , her understanding was beyond every suspicion , quick and clear ; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind .
Your brother is a lieutenant .
I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother 's promotion .
You will , perhaps , like to see them . ''
`` I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William .
I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently .
The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest .
Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before .
His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted .
Her mind was in too much confusion .
She had changed her position ; and , with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows , was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay .
Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house .
Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting .
Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him .
She saw nothing more of her uncle , nor of her aunt Norris , till they met at dinner .
Her uncle 's behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before ; she was sure he did not mean there should be any change , and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any ; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her ; and when she found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt's knowledge could be dwelt on , she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach , exerted on a more momentous subject .
Her manner was incurably gentle ; and she was not aware how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose .
Her diffidence , gratitude , and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial ; seem , at least , to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him .
So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it .
In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising .
`` We have not been so silent all the time , '' replied his mother .
And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed : a volume of Shakespeare .
-- when we heard your footsteps . ''
His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it .
Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny , to see if a word of accordant praise could be extorted from her ; yet both feeling that it could not be .
And he looked at Fanny with an expressive smile , which evidently meant , `` That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . ''
No one but you can tell me them .
I do not mean to press you , however .
But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies .
It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be .
You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power .
Was not he devoted to you at the ball ?
I remember it perfectly . ''
But he was master at Mansfield Park .
In the calmness of her own dressing-room , in the impartial flow of her own meditations , unbiassed by his bewildering statements , she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny 's ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long , while she was so useful to herself .
They passed the drawbridge , and entered the town ; and the light was only beginning to fail as , guided by William 's powerful voice , they were rattled into a narrow street , leading from the High Street , and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price .
We have been looking for you this half-hour .
The Thrush went out of harbour this morning .
And Mr. Campbell was here at four o'clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush's boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ''
how tired you must both be !
And when did you get anything to eat ?
And what would you like to have now ?
And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand .
It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street .
Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . ''
Susan saw that much was wrong at home , and wanted to set it right .
Susan tried to be useful , where _she_ could only have gone away and cried ; and that Susan was useful she could perceive ; that things , bad as they were , would have been worse but for such interposition , and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity .
They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish .
He had reached it late the night before , was come for a day or two , was staying at the Crown , had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival , but had no object of that kind in coming .
She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her .
Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low .
It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .
Edmund had not yet spoken .
She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow .
She would hesitate , she would tease , she would condition , she would require a great deal , but she would finally accept .
`` Why is not it settled ?
He will marry her , and be poor and miserable .
She loves nobody but herself and her brother .
Her friends leading her astray for years !
Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever .
Edmund , you do not know me .
Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise .
Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon .
Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment 's _etourderie_ , thinks of nobody but you .
I wish you may not repent it.
-- Yours , etc . ''
By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house .
The girls heard his entrance from above , and Fanny went down .
The idea of immediately seeing him , with the knowledge of what he must be suffering , brought back all her own first feelings .
Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer .
Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wont with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her .
She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious .
But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle 's house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself .
Nature resisted it for a while .
He submitted to believe that Tom 's illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right .
Once it had , by an opening undesigned and unmerited , led him into the way of happiness .
Her influence over him had already given him some influence over her .
Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , an hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love .
