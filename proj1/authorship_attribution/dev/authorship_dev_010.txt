`` I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter .
At our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything .
Mr. Bingley followed his advice .
Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him .
`` But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
`` Not as you represent it .
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . ''
`` But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure .
`` If we make haste , '' said Lydia , as they walked along , `` perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . ''
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying .
`` And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . ''
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? ''
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .
She would not listen , therefore , to her daughter 's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .
`` You quite mistook Mr. Darcy .
He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ''
`` No , she would go home .
I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies .
`` You are mistaken .
Let me mend it for you .
I mend pens remarkably well . ''
`` How can you contrive to write so even ? ''
`` You have only proved by this , '' cried Elizabeth , `` that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .
`` Perhaps I do .
`` What you ask , '' said Elizabeth , `` is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . ''
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
`` There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however , and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ''
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . ''
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
A clear ten thousand per annum .
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself , for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . ''
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . ''
`` This is quite shocking !
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together , with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham 's attentions .
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
`` I must not decide on my own performance . ''
`` I do not think we were speaking at all .
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . ''
`` Yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _being created_ . ''
`` But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ''
`` I have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !
`` I have no reason , I assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ''
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return .
Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture !
How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters , I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too !
Mrs. Bennet 's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer .
But these things happen so often !
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy 's sister , as by Wickham 's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .
`` No , Lizzy , that is what I do _not_ choose .
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .
At length the Parsonage was discernible .
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .
`` I confess , '' said he , `` that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case .
Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle Lord -- -- , and , to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr. Collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him .
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
She was engaged one day as she walked , in perusing Jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
`` There were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were Colonel Fitzwilliam 's words ; and those strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham -- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane 's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , work-bags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty 's and Lydia 's purchases , were seated in it .
`` I do not know when I have been more shocked , '' said she .
Dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .
I am sure you must feel it so . ''
`` There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ''
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister 's spirits .
Jane was not happy .
_They_ will never be distressed for money .
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of Lydia 's leaving home .
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .
His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . ''
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn .
Everything wore a happier aspect .
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .
The picture-gallery , and two or three of the principal bedrooms , were all that remained to be shown .
In the former were many good paintings ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
It is every way horrible ! ''
But if otherwise -- if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Never , since reading Jane 's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham 's meaning to marry her .
`` I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter .
It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .
`` And my mother -- how is she ?
How are you all ? ''
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .
`` But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .
We acted with the best intentions . ''
`` He brought it with him for us to see . ''
`` Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure ; but I did not think it right for either of them .
Kitty is slight and delicate ; and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .
She was of great use and comfort to us all .
And Lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . ''
There was also a postscript to this effect :
When Mr. Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
`` What do you mean , Hill ?
We have heard nothing from town . ''
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !
it must be my uncle 's doings !
It is useless to talk of it . ''
`` May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? ''
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .
Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ?
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . ''
They must all go to Brighton .
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . ''
`` I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .
Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side .
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done .
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
They were in -- -- street .
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
He had , to be sure , done much .
She read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again .
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself .
`` I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ''
`` I should be sorry indeed , if it were .
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . ''
`` I do not know .
Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .
I am prodigiously proud of him .
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again .
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .
But that is nothing to us .
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
Miss Lucas is married and settled .
And one of my own daughters .
Did you see it ? ''
he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . ''
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs. Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived .
`` Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ''
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .
`` Exceed their income !
I knew how it would be .
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ''
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .
`` I never heard that it was . ''
`` It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .
You may have drawn him in . ''
`` You have insulted me in every possible method .
`` You are then resolved to have him ? ''
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . '
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
cried Elizabeth , `` I am excessively diverted .
You blamed me for coming ? ''
The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister .
His attachment to them all increased .
The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence .
By a former marriage , Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters .
To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small .
Their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life-interest in it .
His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters .
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .
Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : -- he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife .
But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; -- more narrow-minded and selfish .
When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece .
Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it .
She had an excellent heart ; -- her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught .
They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction .
Margaret , the other sister , was a good-humored , well-disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .
He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted .
In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself .
She begged him to think again on the subject .
`` It was my father 's last request to me , '' replied her husband , `` that I should assist his widow and daughters . ''
It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .
But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved .
He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart .
His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement .
But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what .
His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day .
But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches .
All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life .
Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising .
Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ?
Marianne here burst forth with indignation --
On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse .
In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady .
It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass .
He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .
The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected .
In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .
Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother .
`` He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , '' repeated Sir John .
`` I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . ''
`` That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be .
Marianne was still handsomer .
But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay .
`` I can not agree with you there , '' said Elinor .
Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . ''
`` Oh , Elinor ! ''
I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . ''
Margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister .
When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , `` I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? ''
`` Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion .
She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power ; for though Willoughby was independent , there was no reason to believe him rich .
`` To me it is faultless .
`` This is very unfortunate .
For a few moments every one was silent .
She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust .
Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister ; -- the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible .
And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ?
said Marianne to herself as she walked on .
`` As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe .
Come , what is your competence ? ''
`` I wish , '' said Margaret , striking out a novel thought , `` that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! ''
My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding .
You must not confound my meaning .
If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . ''
I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms .
I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . ''
Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
`` Well , '' said he , `` we have brought you some strangers .
I never saw anything so charming !
( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming !
Should not you , Mr .
This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both .
But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way .
Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .
We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know .
Not above ten miles , I dare say . ''
He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . ''
Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much .
But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child 's neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy .
She was seated in her mother 's lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender-water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other .
With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying .
Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell .
`` I should guess so , '' said Elinor , with a smile , `` from what I have witnessed this morning . ''
`` No , '' replied Lucy , `` not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but , '' fixing her eyes upon Elinor , `` to his eldest brother . ''
`` Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister-in-law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . ''
`` Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? ''
`` Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us .
`` I am glad , '' said Lady Middleton to Lucy , `` you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight .
`` Thank you , '' cried Lucy warmly , `` for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . ''
If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . ''
`` That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's .
If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . ''
`` But what , '' said she after a short silence , `` are your views ?
`` Oh , Lord !
I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . ''
So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother 's invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come !
Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it .
Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .
He tried to smile as he replied , `` your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . ''
Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly.
-- I can not rest -- I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other.
`` How can that be done ?
No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait .
Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself .
That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind .
Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it .
In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness ,
Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ?
`` MY DEAR MADAM ,
She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important .
`` No , no , no , it can not be , '' she cried ; `` she can not feel .
Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good-nature is not tenderness .
`` He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . ''
`` If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person .
At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .
She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother .
I have never told you how this was brought on .
I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained .
My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly .
The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural .
Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange .
Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak .
Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend .
She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray 's in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother .
Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . ''
The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars 's general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister's chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice ,
Every body's attention was called , and almost every body was concerned.
Jennings , with a very intelligent `` Ah !
-- But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now ; -- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.
-- They are such charming women !
-- I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . ''
Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence .
`` Oh , do n't think of me ! ''
she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , `` do n't think of MY health .
Elinor is well , you see .
That must be enough for us both . ''
About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing-room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying ,
As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her .
She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind .
`` I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , '' added Elinor ; `` and once or twice I have attempted it ; -- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . ''
The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March .
I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself .
How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? ''
Good-by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .
Remember me kindly to her .
if you have not got your spotted muslin on !
-- I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . ''
-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to .
-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income .
Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great .
very well , '' said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed .
`` Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day . ''
Well , so much the better for him .
But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ?
I go to Oxford tomorrow . ''
cried Mrs. Jennings ; `` Lord !
Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . ''
This living of Colonel Brandon 's -- can it be true ?
-- has he really given it to Edward ?
Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.
Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road .
For the convenience of Charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and Mr. Palmer , travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon , was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival .
HE , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return .
It was then about twelve o'clock , and she returned to her sister 's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .
Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared .
Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much ; -- and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome .
Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother 's arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .
Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep .
The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not .
Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers -- they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience .
I know we shall be happy .
I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study .
By reading only six hours a-day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . ''
Elinor tenderly invited her to be open .
`` I would suppose him , -- Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . ''
`` You are very good.
They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself .
As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle .
His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions .
Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby 's deserts ; -- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .
`` At present , '' continued Elinor , `` he regrets what he has done .
His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself .
-- The inconveniences would have been different .
`` Mrs. Robert Ferrars ! ''
He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice ,
He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits .
Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time .
She repeated it to Edward .
Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete-a-tete before breakfast .
Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder .
Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .
The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.
But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them , and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference .
THAT was due to the folly of Robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away .
When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett 's Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother .
He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter .
Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert , -- a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
What immediately followed is known .
They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages ; -- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy 's instigation , was adopted .
The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned .
Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate .
She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions , and to counteract , by her conduct , her most favourite maxims .
We all admired the noble Manliness of his reply .
Does it appear impossible to your vile and corrupted Palate , to exist on Love ?
Here I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech , by the appearance of a very Handsome young Woman , who was ushured into the Room at the Door of which I had been listening .
( said he . )
A Bed of full-grown Nettles from the West -- .
Before us ran the murmuring brook and behind us ran the turn-pike road .
We were in a mood for contemplation and in a Disposition to enjoy so beautifull a spot .
A general silence prevailed -- A silence , which was by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of the Party .
It was Sir Edward the father of my Deceased Husband .
By his side sate Augusta , and on the same seat with me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea .
LETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle March 18th
`` My Dear Susan ( cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement ) You do not really think they bear the least resemblance to their Father !
He is so very plain !
I feel very much obliged to you for keeping your admiration to yourself . ''
During his reign , Lord Cobham was burnt alive , but I forget what for .
His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France , where he went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt .
But of HER , I shall have occasion to speak more at large in future .
The youngest , Mary , married first the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk , by whom she had one daughter , afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey , who tho ' inferior to her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots , was yet an amiable young woman and famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting .
It was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel before mentioned made their appearance , the former of whom was set in the stocks , took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey , and was beheaded with the Earl of Warwick , and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen .
His Majesty died and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not being quite so bad as his daughter Elizabeth .
Why should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits ?
Why should I feel it more , why should it wound me deeper than those I have experienced before ?
Or is it that our feelings become more acute from being often wounded ?
I must suppose my dear Belle that this is the Case , since I am not conscious of being more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville , Fitzowen , or either of the Crawfords , for all of whom I once felt the most lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman 's heart .
Tell me then dear Belle why I still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward , or why I weep when I behold his Bride , for too surely this is the case -- .
Lady Bridget Darkwood and her sister-in-law , Miss Jane are expected on Friday ; and Colonel Seaton 's family will be with us next week .
This is all most kindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins ; but what can the presence of a dozen indefferent people do to me , but weary and distress me -- .
Such is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while riding in her Ladyship 's Coach -- I dare not be impertinent , as my Mother is always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my way in the world .
`` Do you Ma'am said I ; You are vastly obliging .
I did not , continued I to him , encourage you by saying this at first , that surprise might render the pleasure still Greater . ''
`` In short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to Persuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for him ; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments , or discredit what I told him , his transports , his Raptures , his Extacies are beyond my power to describe . ''
`` Yes , I told him every thing . ''
`` To be sure said I , I AM very Charitable every now and then .
-- I will have the leg of beef and the partridge .
END OF THE FIRST ACT .
A Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal , bought a small Cottage in Pembrokeshire about two years ago .
If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .
`` Very true , very true .
What Miss Anne says , is very true , '' was Mr Shepherd 's rejoinder , and `` Oh !
First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .
I have observed it all my life .
'In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? '
said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) .
'Sixty , ' said I , 'or perhaps sixty-two . '
It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . ''
A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .
Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .
With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth 's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .
She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil .
She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .
`` You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone .
`` Did you go then ?
`` I have not the smallest objection on that account , '' replied Anne .
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .
It is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them .
Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste .
The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in .
those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia !
How fast I made money in her .
You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself .
Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more .
`` Poor dear fellow ! ''
continued Mrs Musgrove ; `` he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care !
it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you .
I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . ''
When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .
A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards .
There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off .
Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless .
She could not even thank him .
His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room .
She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth's interference , `` You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; '' and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself .
The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also .
Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge-row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .
Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her .
would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ?
No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded .
When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! ''
We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's doing , that she did not .
They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . ''
He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man .
Anne felt that she should like to know who he was .
`` Pray , '' said Captain Wentworth , immediately , `` can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? ''
Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London . ''
was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .
Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .
At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said --
She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross .
`` He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens .
Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up , or the taste of the furniture .
Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story .
There had been the charm .
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation .
`` How is Mary looking ? ''
It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .
-- , Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne 's opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .
`` Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style .
She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .
Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .
The Crofts must be in Bath !
A circumstance to interest her .
In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free .
They were too much like joy , senseless joy !
`` None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together .
I am going home . ''
`` Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name .
Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick .
When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward 's , and there he has been ever since .
Even Sophy could not understand it .
I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick . ''
`` Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his .
If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . ''
`` Poor Frederick ! ''
said he at last .
Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath .
Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure .
Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , `` Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . ''
Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room .
`` Perhaps , '' said Mr Elliot , speaking low , `` I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . ''
Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth's brother .
Jealousy of Mr Elliot !
Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago !
For a moment the gratification was exquisite .
How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ?
It was misery to think of Mr Elliot 's attentions .
Their evil was incalculable .
Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father .
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say --
I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing .
His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart .
I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . ''
It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise .
It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along .
`` If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment .
But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . ''
`` I am not yet so much changed , '' cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction .
If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . ''
God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures !
I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object .
I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you .
`` You are a good soul , '' cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately .
Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully .
She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself .
He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant !
`` I found , '' said he , `` that I was considered by Harville an engaged man !
That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment .
I was hers in honour if she wished it .
I had not thought seriously on this subject before .
I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects .
There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston 's wedding-cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it .
`` Only think of our happening to meet him !
-- How very odd !
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to-morrow .
So very odd we should happen to meet !
What do you think of him ?
Do you think him so very plain ? ''
`` Mr. Knightley 's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _him_ .
You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley .
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .
They might be more safely held up as a pattern .
There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good-humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied .
Mr. Elton is good-humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? ''
I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .
Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.
Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston 's on the subject , as much as possible .
There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to `` What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? ''
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith 's .
Exactly so indeed ! ''
Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .
`` Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
You have cured her of her school-girl's giggle ; she really does you credit . ''
He is desperately in love and means to marry her . ''
Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard 's to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist-club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
This is saying very plainly -- 'Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . '
Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
`` There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , '' said she , `` that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions .
I am very happy .
This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .
This is a connexion which offers nothing but good .
It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .
`` Leave it to me .
He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.
-- Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming .
-- But -- ( in a very depressed tone ) -- she is coming for only one week .
`` Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
I am sure she will be pleased with the children .
`` He appears rough to you , '' said Emma , `` because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
so charming as you are ! ''
They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery-maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
`` Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.
-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.
`` My poor dear Isabella , '' said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children -- '' How long it is , how terribly long since you were here !
My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . ''
I trust , at least , that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill , '' turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband .
Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ; -- even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .
That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations .
Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing-room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.
-- Judge between us .
I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . ''
`` It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .
You have made yourself too clear .
Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
There I was quite right .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala-day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston 's arguments against herself .
A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill -- 'Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going . ''
yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing -- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was -- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there .
Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
said she ; 'well , that is quite unexpected .
`` Yes , that of course . ''
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter 's marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
These were charming feelings -- but not lasting .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .
which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation .
I did not know what to do .
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !
Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
dear , I thought it would have been the death of me !
So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
And Elizabeth , too .
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton .
Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .
`` Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.
-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .
-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . ''
The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived .
Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection .
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
`` Thank you for rousing me , '' he replied .
How else could they come ? ''
`` Well , '' said Mrs. Weston , smiling , `` you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
-- What do you say to it ? ''
Knightley must not marry !
no , no , Henry must have Donwell .
I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .
Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .
My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine . ''
`` She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . ''
`` No more it is . ''
To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs .
You see we have been wedging one leg with paper .
`` It is not fair , '' said Emma , in a whisper ; `` mine was a random guess .
Do not distress her . ''
Shortly afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off .
`` Yes , '' said Jane , `` we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . ''
It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight .
`` The old lady !
No , the young lady , to be sure .
I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ''
`` Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately .
I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . ''
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners !
It was all my doing , I know .
Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . ''
There was a little hesitation in Emma 's answer .
no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.
-- A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . ''
`` No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head .
I am delighted to find myself in such a circle .
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
Will not it be a good plan ?
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
The result of his reverie was , `` No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.
And soon afterwards , `` Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect .
She has a fault .
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout-cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties .
Mrs. Bates , Mrs. Perry , Mrs. Goddard and others , were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged .
In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.
`` That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
`` If we were in the other room , '' said Emma , `` if I had my writing-desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? ''
`` Here is April come ! ''
Your inexperience really amuses me !
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . ''
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.
-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !
John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , `` I could not have believed it even of _him_ . ''
Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .
He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
Well , what do you say to it ?
After tea , Mr. and Mrs. Weston , and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to cards .
You think so , do not you ? ''
He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.
-- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .
`` I shall not scold you .
I leave you to your own reflections . ''
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment .
The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
`` And had you really some at hand yourself ?
I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . ''
I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls .
Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
`` Aye , very true , my dear , '' cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word -- '' I was just going to say the same thing .
The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us .
We really must wish you good night . ''
`` Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? ''
now you are looking very sly .
I am no young lady on her preferment .
Married women , you know , may be safely authorised .
Leave it all to me .
`` That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day : -- but as you like .
I must order the carriage .
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her .
They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another .
She still intended him for her friend .
`` Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
-- I will tell you.
You shall have a charming wife . ''
Time did not compose her .
There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .
Emma was most sincerely interested .
She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax 's advantage and comfort as possible .
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . ''
She would not let Jane say , 'No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind !
Quite a surprize to me !
I had not the least idea !
`` Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse .
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance .
-- A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere .
-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.
It was felt as such things must be felt .
Mrs. Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty-five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances .
It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .
But what can be the matter ?
-- Is she really not ill ? ''
She paused a few moments .
Emma could not speak .
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.
-- Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ?
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest and affection.
She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.
-- Not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.
Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.
-- Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.
She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley .
But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .
The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter 's side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness .
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr. Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
`` Well , there _is_ feeling here.
I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.
'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . '
The child of good fortune !
`` I am sure William Larkins will not like it .
Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .
no , the meeting is certainly to-day , '' was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton 's side.
`` Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , '' replied Emma , smiling -- '' but , excuse me , it must be thought of . ''
`` That is , '' replied Mr. Knightley , `` she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
`` There is one subject , '' he replied , `` I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . ''
`` Does nothing occur to you ?
-- Harriet Smith . ''
`` Good God ! ''
-- Let me know it all .
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ? ''
`` I am quite sure , '' he replied , speaking very distinctly , `` that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .
The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.
-- What had she to wish for ?
Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
Sally , or rather Sarah ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? )
, must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister .
It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine 's writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce .
Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank-bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it .
Such words had their due effect ; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before -- her humble vanity was contented -- she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms , and went to her chair in good humour with everybody , and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention .
Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius .
`` I hope I am , madam . ''
`` And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland 's gown ? ''
`` That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ''
`` Have you , indeed !
I hope you have not been here long ? ''
`` It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody 's admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless .
Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object !
`` I am sure I can not guess at all . ''
Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe 's , had more real elegance .
Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it .
But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback .
There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be .
Our foggy climate wants help . ''
To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose !
-- it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity .
This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine's attention , for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies .
We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening , and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time .
Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one , without injuring the rights of the other .
This disposition on your side is rather alarming .
You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations ; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish ?
`` I do not think I should be tired , if I were to stay here six months . ''
You would be told so by people of all descriptions , who come regularly every winter , lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve , and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer . ''
Miss Tilney , to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar , spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too ; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her , it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk , some morning or other .
This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney 's , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not .
Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home .
`` There are four umbrellas up already .
How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! ''
There will be very few people in the pump-room , if it rains all the morning .
`` My dear , you tumble my gown , '' was Mrs. Allen 's reply .
`` No , it would not be easy .
But all in vain ; Catherine felt herself to be in the right , and though pained by such tender , such flattering supplication , could not allow it to influence her .
But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody 's ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own .
`` Thank ye , '' cried Thorpe , `` but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool .
No , if you do not go , d -- -- me if I do .
`` I hope I am not less so now , '' she replied , very feelingly ; `` but indeed I can not go .
If I am wrong , I am doing what I believe to be right . ''
Whatever might have been felt before her arrival , her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire .
You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions .
`` I am sure , '' cried Catherine , `` I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it is a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? ''
I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me .
`` Historians , you think , '' said Miss Tilney , `` are not happy in their flights of fancy .
If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made -- and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . ''
The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say .
They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing , and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures , with all the eagerness of real taste .
Here Catherine was quite lost .
And you , Miss Morland -- my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions .
dear , not at all .
Isabella 's opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts .
From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that , whatever might be our heroine 's opinion of him , his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind ; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers , nor persecutions to the lady .
Catherine , meanwhile , undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil , or of any evil at all , except that of having but a short set to dance down , enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney , listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said ; and , in finding him irresistible , becoming so herself .
`` Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , '' said Mrs. Thorpe , `` we perfectly see into your heart .
We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ''
I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me .
I will look another way .
`` Well , '' said Catherine , after some moments ' consideration , `` you may be able to guess at your brother 's intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .
`` No , certainly .
But you must be aware that when a young lady is ( by whatever means ) introduced into a dwelling of this kind , she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family .
Can you stand such a ceremony as this ?
It was snuffed and extinguished in one .
A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect .
Catherine trembled from head to foot .
Human nature could support no more .
To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question .
The manuscript so wonderfully found , so wonderfully accomplishing the morning 's prediction , how was it to be accounted for ?
To whom could it relate ?
By what means could it have been so long concealed ?
The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear .
Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans .
`` And how might you learn ?
The whole building enclosed a large court ; and two sides of the quadrangle , rich in Gothic ornaments , stood forward for admiration .
The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees , or luxuriant plantations , and the steep woody hills rising behind , to give it shelter , were beautiful even in the leafless month of March .
The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired .
Eleanor's countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing .
Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her !
The name of `` Eleanor '' at the same moment , in his loudest tone , resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror .
She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment .
No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors .
And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , `` My father only wanted me to answer a note , '' she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the general , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so .
The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being .
She saw a large , well-proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid 's care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows !
She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else !
Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she had last read , remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper ?
No : whatever might have been the general 's crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection .
At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery .
He looked astonished too .
she continued , not attending to his address .
How came you up that staircase ? ''
`` No , nothing at all .
I thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow . ''
She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him .
They walked slowly up the gallery .
`` Promised so faithfully !
It is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you .
My mother 's room is very commodious , is it not ?
It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own .
She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ''
Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat .
She turned into the drawing-room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her .
Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , `` I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ''
Poor James is so unhappy !
I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ''
`` Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ''
Henry was not able to obey his father 's injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights .
They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed , as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge , that a carriage was driving up to the door , and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house-bell .
In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea-table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her .
The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine 's head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her .
Her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen .
Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again !
And it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ''
To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well ; and professing myself moreover convinced that the general 's unjust interference , so far from being really injurious to their felicity , was perhaps rather conducive to it , by improving their knowledge of each other , and adding strength to their attachment , I leave it to be settled , by whomsoever it may concern , whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny , or reward filial disobedience .
I found a dismal letter from him on my arrival here , full of complaints of his wife and sister , and lamentations on the cruelty of his fate .
I passed off the letter as his wife 's , to the Vernons , and when I write to him it must be under cover to you .
MR. DE COURCY TO SIR REGINALD
Mr. Johnson has hit on the most effectual manner of plaguing us all .
In the course of my journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for reflection on the present state of our affairs , and every review has served to convince me that they require a delicacy and cautiousness of conduct to which we have hitherto been too little attentive .
We have been hurried on by our feelings to a degree of precipitation which ill accords with the claims of our friends or the opinion of the world .
It is not for us to blame any expectations on your father 's side of your marrying to advantage ; where possessions are so extensive as those of your family , the wish of increasing them , if not strictly reasonable , is too common to excite surprize or resentment .
With feelings so poignant as mine , the conviction of having divided the son from his parents would make me , even with you , the most miserable of beings .
I can not bear reproaches : my spirits are not so high as to need being repressed .
I must endeavour to seek amusement , and fortunately many of my friends are in town ; amongst them the Mainwarings ; you know how sincerely I regard both husband and wife .
My dear Creature , -- I am in agonies , and know not what to do .
She came to this house to entreat my husband 's interference , and before I could be aware of it , everything that you could wish to be concealed was known to him , and unluckily she had wormed out of Mainwaring 's servant that he had visited you every day since your being in town , and had just watched him to your door herself !
What could I do !
Do not accuse me ; indeed , it was impossible to prevent it .
With anxious wishes , Yours faithfully ,
Lady Bertram made no opposition .
But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are ; -- on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . ''
The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders .
There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas 's conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do .
`` I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , '' said Fanny modestly .
She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ''
You always do , do n't you ? ''
Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual .
They left England with the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent .
let him stand his chance and be taken in .
Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ''
`` I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , '' said Miss Crawford , as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams .
`` The house was built in Elizabeth 's time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms .
It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement .
But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of .
`` It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all , '' said Fanny .
Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish !
`` Among admirals , large enough ; but , '' with an air of grandeur , `` we know very little of the inferior ranks .
Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies .
But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used .
Certainly , my home at my uncle 's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals .
Of _Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough .
`` And very ungrateful , I think . ''
Miss Crawford 's enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off .
Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund 's attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount .
To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out .
A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another ; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after .
It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good-humour , on Mr. Rushworth 's account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home .
`` I am afraid it was , indeed , '' said the more candid Lady Bertram , who had overheard her ; `` I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody .
Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower-beds , was almost too much for me . ''
Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper-tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part .
Having been out some time , and taken a different route to the house , they had not met him .
Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home .
It was hardly possible , indeed , that anything else should be talked of , for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it ; and Mrs. Rushworth , a well-meaning , civil , prosing , pompous woman , who thought nothing of consequence , but as it related to her own and her son 's concerns , had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party .
Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris 's more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth .
She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question .
`` Besides , '' said Maria , `` I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us .
After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ''
`` There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , '' said Edmund , `` in going on the barouche box . ''
cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : `` My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .
How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ''
`` _Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect .
`` I must move , '' said she ; `` resting fatigues me .
`` It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , '' said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone .
`` My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly .
As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ''
`` I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word .
We can not attempt to defend Dr .
`` Not in the least .
`` We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , '' said he , turning his back on the window ; and as it advanced , she had the mortification of seeing him advance too , moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument , and when it ceased , he was close by the singers , among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again .
Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so .
As he said this , each looked towards their mother .
Lady Bertram , sunk back in one corner of the sofa , the picture of health , wealth , ease , and tranquillity , was just falling into a gentle doze , while Fanny was getting through the few difficulties of her work for her .
this wo n't do , '' cried Tom , throwing himself into a chair with a hearty laugh .
`` To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety -- I was unlucky there . ''
The business of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle ; and the carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements , had suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties , and having made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident , was already at work , while a play was still to seek .
I do not know how I shall like it . ''
In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , `` I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _you_ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it .
`` I am sorry for it , '' was his answer ; `` but in this matter it is _you_ who are to lead .
_You_ must set the example .
`` Do not you think he would ? ''
`` My opinion ! ''
she cried , shrinking from such a compliment , highly as it gratified her .
After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning , there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _now_ , when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect ; but I can think of no other alternative .
Can you , Fanny ? ''
Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas 's return . ''
The morrow came , the plan for the evening continued , and Fanny's consideration of it did not become less agitated .
She worked very diligently under her aunt 's directions , but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent , anxious mind ; and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room , that she might have no concern in another , and , as she deemed it , most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act , which Henry Crawford was just proposing , desirous at once of having her time to herself , and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth .
Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well ?
She was properly punished .
The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it .
The Crawfords laughed at the idea ; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves , proposed Mr. Yates's accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage .
It had left her nothing to do .
To the theatre he went , and reached it just in time to witness the first meeting of his father and his friend .
The removal of the bookcase from before the billiard-room door struck him especially , but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this , before there were sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther .
Some one was talking there in a very loud accent ; he did not know the voice -- more than talking -- almost hallooing .
His father 's looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account .
The house would close with the greatest eclat .
Tom understood his father 's thoughts , and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression , began to see , more clearly than he had ever done before , that there might be some ground of offence , that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room ; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table , he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity .
A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all .
Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth 's opinion in better words than he could find himself .
He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well-judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly .
Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning ; but by looking , as he really felt , most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's good opinion , and saying scarcely anything , he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer .
`` We have all been more or less to blame , '' said he , `` every one of us , excepting Fanny .
She never ceased to think of what was due to you .
Sir Thomas gave up the point , foiled by her evasions , disarmed by her flattery ; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake , her kindness did sometimes overpower her judgment .
`` I suppose I am graver than other people , '' said Fanny .
`` The evenings do not appear long to me .
I could listen to him for an hour together .
It entertains _me_ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ''
`` Why should you dare say _that_ ? ''
But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ?
Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ''
She went , however , and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant 's shrubbery , the weather being unusually mild for the time of year , and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered , remaining there perhaps till , in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny 's on the sweets of so protracted an autumn , they were forced , by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them , to jump up and walk for warmth .
There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk !
Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? ''
It was the first time of his seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing of with great satisfaction .
`` They can not have been sitting long , '' cried Mrs. Grant , `` for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ''
I understand you -- and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions .
What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance ?
You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence .
I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . ''
But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . ''
`` No , I never inquire .
But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey , and he agreed to it . ''
I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting .
I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to-morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion .
Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours .
It is without a drawback . ''
The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good-humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour 's rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford 's would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else .
His nephew 's introduction to Admiral Crawford might be of service .
Fanny 's spirits lived on it half the morning , deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away .
cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford 's , `` you are all considerate thought !
You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded .
You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ''
Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel was advanced for her use ; and everything that an affectionate mother _must_ feel in promoting her children 's enjoyment was attributed to her nature .
Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , `` She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ''
missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt .
I may be discovered by those who want to see me .
And the next day _did_ bring a surprise to her .
Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did , and be back in ten minutes , but he was gone above an hour ; and when his sister , who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden , met him at last most impatiently in the sweep , and cried out , `` My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ''
As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence , he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen ; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself , though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations , nothing to dwell on but Fanny 's charms .
Fanny 's beauty of face and figure , Fanny 's graces of manner and goodness of heart , were the exhaustless theme .
Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise .
What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness ?
Nor was this all .
cried Mary ; `` settle in Northamptonshire !
Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring .
Here are the letters which announce it , this moment come to hand .
Mr. Crawford was not only in the room -- he was soon close to her .
He had a note to deliver from his sister .
Fanny could not look at him , but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice .
She opened her note immediately , glad to have anything to do , and happy , as she read it , to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris , who was also to dine there , screened her a little from view .
The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice .
With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , etc.
Mr. Crawford 's business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece 's mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself .
He talked , therefore , for several minutes without Fanny's daring to interrupt him .
She had hardly even attained the wish to do it .
For a moment he ceased , but she had barely become conscious of it , when , rising from his chair , he said , `` And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to .
Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness , and with a good deal of cold sternness , said , `` It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you .
We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference .
But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice .
The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment's share in your thoughts on this occasion .
You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again .
After half a moment 's pause : `` And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _half_ the eligibility of _this_ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it .
I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect .
You do not owe me the duty of a child .
But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_ -- ''
Fanny knew her own meaning , but was no judge of her own manner .
She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment .
She must be courteous , and she must be compassionate .
She must have a sensation of being honoured , and whether thinking of herself or her brother , she must have a strong feeling of gratitude .
Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity .
`` Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . ''
`` Do you , ma'am ? ''
cried he , with quickness .
`` No , no , that will never be .
Your ladyship is quite mistaken .
If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done .
I have no idea of it .
I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him .
Can there be any disagreement between us here ? ''
`` You spent your time pleasantly there ? ''
And then before the ball , the necklace !
`` Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ?
A very , very kind embrace , and some agitation of manner , accompanied these words .
When he had really resolved on any measure , he could always carry it through ; and now by dint of long talking on the subject , explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's sometimes seeing her family , he did induce his wife to let her go ; obtaining it rather from submission , however , than conviction , for Lady Bertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go , and therefore that she must .
And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris 's discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing .
It had , in fact , occurred to her , that though taken to Portsmouth for nothing , it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again .
So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years ' absence , perhaps , begun .
The next morning saw them off again at an early hour ; and with no events , and no delays , they regularly advanced , and were in the environs of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her , and wonder at the new buildings .
Fanny was all agitation and flutter ; all hope and apprehension .
The moment they stopped , a trollopy-looking maidservant , seemingly in waiting for them at the door , stepped forward , and more intent on telling the news than giving them any help , immediately began with , `` The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to -- '' She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old , who , rushing out of the house , pushed the maid aside , and while William was opening the chaise-door himself , called out , `` You are just in time .
It was a beautiful sight .
And they think she will have her orders in a day or two .
I began to think you would never come .
I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready .
Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher interest .
The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home , the first which her judgment could entirely approve , and which gave any promise of durability , was in a better knowledge of Susan , and a hope of being of service to her .
That a girl of fourteen , acting only on her own unassisted reason , should err in the method of reform , was not wonderful ; and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly , than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led .
Susan was only acting on the same truths , and pursuing the same system , which her own judgment acknowledged , but which her more supine and yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting .
She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port-admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard .
She was so little equal to Rebecca's puddings and Rebecca 's hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates , and not half-cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns .
Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day .
As for the main subject of the letter , there was nothing in that to soothe irritation .
She was almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund .
He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain .
She looked over the letter again .
I firmly believe it .
It is an attachment to govern his whole life .
The families would never be connected if you did not connect them !
Finish it at once .
Nobody else could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off ; not even Mrs. Price , beyond a brief question or two , if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand , and now and then the quiet observation of , `` My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ''
Her representation of her cousin 's state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for .
Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again .
If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them .
But why would not you let us come for you ?
She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour .
He was alone , and met her instantly ; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words , just articulate , `` My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ''
She could say nothing ; nor for some minutes could he say more .
Susan too was a grievance .
However that might be , she was unmanageable .
Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier .
It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment ; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason .
Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind .
Fanny 's friendship was all that he had to cling to .
His affection had already done something .
Would he have deserved more , there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained , especially when that marriage had taken place , which would have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first inclination , and brought them very often together .
Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund's marrying Mary .
Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect .
