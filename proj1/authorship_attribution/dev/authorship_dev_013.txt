`` What an excellent father you have , girls ! ''
Lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ''
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .
`` _You_ began the evening well , Charlotte , '' said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .
`` _You_ were Mr. Bingley 's first choice . ''
But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . ''
`` Another time , Lizzy , '' said her mother , `` I would not dance with _him_ , if I were you . ''
Had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began :
`` Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .
Mr. Bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ''
They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are they not ? ''
He immediately offered to fetch her others -- all that his library afforded .
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .
`` All young ladies accomplished !
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .
`` Indeed , Mamma , you are mistaken , '' said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you .
`` My style of writing is very different from yours . ''
`` I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . ''
Arguments are too much like disputes .
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music .
`` I hope , '' said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , `` you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after officers .
`` I hope , my dear , '' said Mr. Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , `` that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ''
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
`` Yes , '' replied Mr. Wickham ; `` his estate there is a noble one .
`` Upon my word , I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .
Everybody is disgusted with his pride .
He deserves to be publicly disgraced . ''
`` I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley !
Do you know Mr .
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips 's supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody .
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .
Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ''
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . ''
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for , to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn , and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
`` I am not now to learn , '' replied Mr. Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , `` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time .
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her .
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .
Elizabeth quietly answered `` Undoubtedly ; '' and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
She had always felt that Charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
`` I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail .
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? ''
`` And men take care that they should . ''
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ''
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .
`` I am sorry it went off .
A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent . ''
`` Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often .
At least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . ''
`` I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . ''
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .
She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions .
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ''
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ''
Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received .
She saw instantly that her cousin 's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family .
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! ''
`` One of them does . ''
Charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding :
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins 's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out :
`` Yes , indeed , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said :
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from want of money .
`` You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said Darcy , in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` This must be false !
This must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
she cried ; `` I , who have prided myself on my discernment !
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust !
How humiliating is this discovery !
Yet , how just a humiliation !
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind !
Till this moment I never knew myself . ''
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt .
Mr. Darcy 's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .
She studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
They were hopeless of remedy .
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia 's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there forever .
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too !
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
It is really too distressing .
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and , from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .
They look upon it as quite their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . ''
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe .
Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of June , Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush .
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Georgiana 's reception of them was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
`` My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance ; and we shall be off , I hope , in half-an-hour .
How is such a man to be worked on ?
How are they even to be discovered ?
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purpose .
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ''
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
`` Perhaps it would have been better , '' replied her sister .
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .
`` I will go to Meryton , '' said she , `` as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long .
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . ''
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained .
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance .
Is not he a charming man ?
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .
That is the place to get husbands .
`` Very true ; and if I had my will , we should .
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _you_ .
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _his_ design .
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
`` Yours , very sincerely ,
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .
And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . ''
`` I have heard from authority , which I thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ''
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
Not that I care about it , though .
And who knows what _may_ happen ?
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? ''
Mrs. Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could .
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house .
But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed .
`` I began to be afraid you would never come back again .
It was in The Times and The Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
`` It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , '' continued her mother , `` but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay I do not know how long .
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the -- -- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .
`` Yes , very indifferent indeed , '' said Elizabeth , laughingly .
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
Mrs. Bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual .
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
I always said it must be so , at last .
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : --
`` But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . ''
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ''
`` You can now have nothing further to say , '' she resentfully answered .
I must beg to return to the house . ''
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .
You ought certainly to forgive them , as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . '
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
You are not going to be _missish_ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
`` I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at Pemberley .
Their estate was large , and their residence was at Norland Park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance .
But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; -- but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods .
The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters .
He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a-piece .
Mr. Dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement .
But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth .
He was not an ill-disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties .
He then really thought himself equal to it .
The prospect of four thousand a-year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity.
-- He thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent .
No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing ; -- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immovable disgust .
She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation .
She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent .
The agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again .
They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future .
As such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child .
A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind .
But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .
Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters .
To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree .
And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount .
It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ?
This argument was irresistible .
Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible .
Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address .
They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other .
Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .
It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness .
In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from hers ! ''
He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it .
He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . ''
`` And you really are not engaged to him ! ''
`` Yet it certainly soon will happen .
But two advantages will proceed from this delay .
I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity .
if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! ''
Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .
Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage .
Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's independent employments were in existence only half the time .
The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate .
He was silent and grave .
`` Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ?
`` Mama , you are not doing me justice .
He may live twenty years longer .
But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony . ''
Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . ''
`` Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other .
he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . ''
Her form , though not so correct as her sister 's , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common cant of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens .
`` That is exactly what I think of him , '' cried Marianne .
I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama .
It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; -- it is disposition alone .
Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others .
I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby .
I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . ''
A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head .
`` You would not be six hours later , '' said Willoughby , `` if you were to defer your journey till our return . ''
`` I have no doubt of it , '' replied Marianne .
`` Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . ''
I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . ''
`` I am , '' said he .
He engaged to be with them by four o'clock .
Elinor felt equal amazement .
But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty .
Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings !
You had rather take evil upon credit than good .
You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter .
You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn .
Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ?
And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? ''
`` How strange ! ''
I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way .
`` What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? ''
`` Grandeur has but little , '' said Elinor , `` but wealth has much to do with it . ''
`` Perhaps , '' said Elinor , smiling , `` we may come to the same point .
`` TWO thousand a year !
ONE is my wealth !
I guessed how it would end . ''
All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour .
`` She knows her own worth too well for false shame , '' replied Edward .
`` Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other .
I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees .
I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing .
I do not like ruined , tattered cottages .
`` Is that Fanny 's hair ?
I remember her promising to give you some .
But I should have thought her hair had been darker . ''
How do you like them ? ''
they will hear you . ''
what a delightful room this is !
Only think , Mama , how it is improved since I was here last !
But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come .
Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield .
`` Oh , do n't be so sly before us , '' said Mrs. Palmer ; `` for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome .
`` I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred . ''
Mr. Palmer took no notice of her .
`` Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.
-- He was a particular friend of Sir John 's .
I believe , '' she added in a low voice , `` he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could .
The mother 's consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer .
She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.
`` We can mean no other , '' cried Lucy , smiling .
And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . ''
I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs .
or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ?
-- Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? ''
It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT .
I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault .
`` I am delighted with the plan , '' she cried , `` it is exactly what I could wish .
You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again !
I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one .
You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .
And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . ''
`` Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , '' said Elinor , `` you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . ''
Mrs. Dashwood smiled , and said nothing .
They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer 's barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again .
From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing .
Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced .
He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word .
It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of `` your sister looks unwell to-day , '' or `` your sister seems out of spirits , '' he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her .
After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ?
`` Go to him , Elinor , '' she cried , as soon as she could speak , `` and force him to come to me .
-- Oh go to him this moment . ''
Wait only till tomorrow . ''
Lady Middleton , though in the middle of a rubber , on being informed that Marianne was unwell , was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away , and making over her cards to a friend , they departed as soon the carriage could be found .
Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street .
Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation .
`` For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood !
Come , come , this wo n't do .
Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long .
I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . ''
`` Law , my dear !
Do n't pretend to defend him .
after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! ''
All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . ''
This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father .
Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends .
I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate !
We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland .
I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it .
But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?
It was THAT which threw this gloom , -- even now the recollection of what I suffered -- ''
He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect .
A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure .
Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it .
Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal .
Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed , or in her dressing gown , and therefore not able to come to them .
`` I believe about two thousand a year . ''
poor dear , '' immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair .
`` Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.
Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself .
Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself !
Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.
-- Marianne's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
cried Elinor ; `` have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ?
`` Oh , la !
I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer .
He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach .
I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes .
I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout .
-- she cried , with great agitation .
`` The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty , '' -- he replied , with great feeling , -- '' of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.
I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him .
He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more .
This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly .
A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ; --
`` Oh , ho !
Should not the Colonel write himself ?
-- sure , he is the proper person . ''
And away she went ; but returning again in a moment ,
`` Well , my dear , '' she cried , `` I sent you up the young man .
Did not I do right ?
`` Two or three months ! ''
my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
-- I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience !
Elinor made what excuse she could for her .
-- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . ''
-- His reflections ended thus .
In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .
Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger .
Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery .
At seven o'clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea .
The night was cold and stormy .
`` You did then , '' said Elinor , a little softened , `` believe yourself at one time attached to her ? ''
Elinor stopped him with a reproof .
We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached .
Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement .
I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved .
I shall now live solely for my family .
From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance .
Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby 's story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .
But it was neither in Elinor 's power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself .
Marianne sighed , and repeated , `` I wish for no change . ''
-- Because he finds it has not answered towards himself .
It has not made him happy .
-- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ; -- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder .
How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told .
This only need be said ; -- that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men .
He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love ; -- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire .
The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night .
NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place .
But so little interest had he taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject .
About four days after Edward 's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood 's satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold .
Mr. Dashwood 's strains were more solemn .
Robert 's offence was unpardonable , but Lucy 's was infinitely worse .
The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re-established him completely in her favour .
In that point , however , and that only , he erred ; -- for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction .
Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself .
His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course .
But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self-condemnation for Robert 's offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence .
Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together .
Elinor 's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .
It was now her darling object .
Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor .
She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another !
`` And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love , Augusta ?
( replied my Edward ) .
I soon perceived that tho ' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho' Easy and Polite in her Address , she was of that inferior order of Beings with regard to Delicate Feeling , tender Sentiments , and refined Sensibility , of which Augusta was one .
The amiable M'Kenrie , whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had been the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of his affection for Janetta , on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of Love to Macdonald-Hall , and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her who inspired it , that after a few more private interveiws , Sophia and I experienced the satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green , which they chose for the celebration of their Nuptials , in preference to any other place although it was at a considerable distance from Macdonald-Hall .
`` It must indeed be a most gratefull reflection , to your exalted minds . ''
As soon as we had packed up our wardrobe and valuables , we left Macdonald Hall , and after having walked about a mile and a half we sate down by the side of a clear limpid stream to refresh our exhausted limbs .
The place was suited to meditation .
A mutual silence which had for some time reigned between us , was at length broke by my exclaiming -- '' What a lovely scene !
Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties with us ? ''
LETTER the 14th LAURA in continuation
It was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish the Number of my Fellow-travellers ; I could only perceive that they were many .
Imagine my surprise at finding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance .
Heavens , ( exclaimed I ) is it possible that I should so unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations and Connections ? ''
These words roused the rest of the Party , and every eye was directed to the corner in which I sat .
when we last parted in the Vale of Usk , I was happy in being united to the best of Edwards ; I had then a Father and a Mother , and had never known misfortunes -- But now deprived of every freind but you -- ''
Do not you think the Miss Lesleys are two very handsome young Women ? ''
I executed my Plan with great Punctuality .
I can not say success , for alas !
my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease her ; on the contrary she actually said to me one day `` Well Charlotte , I am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous custom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made my head ake , and yourself hoarse .
This was the only very severe thing I ever said in my Life ; not but that I have often felt myself extremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings public .
This Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and amiable , forsaking all his dissipated companions , and never thrashing Sir William again .
By this Marriage he had two sons and two daughters , the elder of which Daughters was married to the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother to one of the first Characters in the World .
Though this King had some faults , among which and as the most principal , was his allowing his Mother 's death , yet considered on the whole I can not help liking him .
He married Anne of Denmark , and had several Children ; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before his father or he might have experienced the evils which befell his unfortunate Brother .
Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors ?
I will not finish my Letter till some of our Visitors are arrived .
`` But did not you own it , and assume his name at your husband 's death ? ''
but my Sophia why are YOU unhappy ? ''
`` Have you not heard Madam of Willoughby 's Marriage ? ''
-- When we arrived at Ashburnham , it was nearly ten o'clock , which was an hour and a half later than we were desired to be there ; but Lady Greville is too fashionable ( or fancies herself to be so ) to be punctual .
The Dancing however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville .
In the mean time the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went exactly before me -- She saw me and instantly stopping , said to me though there were several people close to us ,
But pray Lady Scudamore did your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like him the better if he did , for what is a Lover without a Confidante ? ''
`` It is an affecting Circumstance indeed , replied Lady Scudamore . ''
`` Did not I say that it was unknown to yourself ?
`` No Cousin replied he in a languid voice , nothing will convince me that I can have touched the heart of Henrietta Halton , and if you are deceived yourself , do not attempt deceiving me . ''
And what did Mr Musgrove say to this ? ''
Popgun ) My Girl , my Darling , my favourite of all my Children , who art the picture of thy poor Mother who died two months ago , with whom I am going to Town to marry to Strephon , and to whom I mean to bequeath my whole Estate , it wants seven Miles .
And now I will sing another song .
`` If we can persuade your father to all this , '' said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , `` much may be done .
What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ?
There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct .
Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .
`` Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it .
A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .
'Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , 'forty , and no more . '
I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen .
Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral 's family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .
He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .
A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children .
He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .
`` You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? ''
Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .
A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne 's share of suffering from it .
That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature 's having heard of it from him .
The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . ''
Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . ''
`` I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . ''
They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father 's having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .
As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife 's , and his practice not so bad .
And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , `` Oh !
They are quite different creatures with you !
They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears !
without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated -- !
how troublesome they are sometimes .
I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should .
She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .
She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation .
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .
She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re-perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death .
A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man .
Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? ''
A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands .
I shall never forget his happiness .
He felt it all , so much for her sake .
I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean . ''
`` And I do assure you , ma'am , '' pursued Mrs Croft , `` that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates .
I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me .
I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . ''
It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to .
But neither Charles Hayter 's feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own .
She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .
She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .
I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense .
`` I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary .
I wish she had accepted him .
`` And yet , '' said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , `` he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have .
He will rally again , and be happy with another . ''
It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman's looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners .
He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .
`` Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth .
`` Then it is settled , Musgrove , '' cried Captain Wentworth , `` that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home .
But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one .
Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne . ''
When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .
There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell 's joy in meeting her .
`` Yes , that he will ! ''
exclaimed Mary , tauntingly .
Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? ''
The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .
They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .
Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .
Everybody was wanting to visit them .
They had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .
She was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend .
She had sought him .
Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman .
A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !
They did not always think alike .
His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers .
The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No .
No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland .
The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed .
It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots . ''
then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , `` I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance .
I suppose '' ( smiling ) `` I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . ''
Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .
She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .
Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel !
She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .
The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted .
The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction .
He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him .
When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate .
I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names .
I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort .
The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right .
Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward .
But now , the matter has taken the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick .
You know James Benwick . ''
There is something about Frederick more to our taste . ''
`` Now he must begin all over again with somebody else .
It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson .
Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? ''
They were in Milsom Street .
He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes .
But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone .
Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke .
He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle `` How do you do ? ''
Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done .
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment .
He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .
there were very different thoughts to succeed .
How was the truth to reach him ?
They never miss a concert . ''
`` And -- were you much acquainted ? ''
He truly wants to marry you .
Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object .
She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side .
She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .
I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you .
After waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling , `` It is a period , indeed !
Eight years and a half is a period . ''
`` We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . ''
`` We shall never agree upon this question , '' Captain Harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth 's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room .
cried Anne eagerly , `` I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you .
I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman .
`` There is no quarrelling with you .
I was startled and shocked .
To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
I had been unguarded .
I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . ''
`` Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject .
It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
He did not think we ever walked this road .
He thought we walked towards Randalls most days .
He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet .
Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
`` To be sure , '' said Harriet , in a mortified voice , `` he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . ''
But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to .
What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ?
You must see the difference . ''
Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .
On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model .
If he means any thing , it must be to please you .
The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .
But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.
There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr .
Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .
It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office . ''
So much superadded decision of character !
Skilful has been the hand ! ''
`` Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin .
`` You could not have visited me ! ''
she cried , looking aghast .
`` No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before .
-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . ''
I must have given you up . ''
Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much .
The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin .
`` Come , '' said he , `` you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .
Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , `` that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . ''
I have read worse charades .
This is feeling your way .
You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
I thought it must be so .
I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural .
Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other !
I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?
She pondered , but could think of nothing .
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
`` I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married !
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
`` Me , my love , '' cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part.
-- `` Are you talking about me ?
-- You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together .
`` I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .
In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas .
She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
`` I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . ''
She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of .
I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston .
Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? ''
`` One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , '' replied Mrs. Weston .
`` One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . ''
`` So scrupulous for others , '' he continued , `` and yet so careless for herself !
She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .
Is this fair , Mrs .
I am sure of your kind support and aid . ''
I am not at all afraid .
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
`` Here have I , '' said she , `` actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him .
I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ; -- William Coxe -- Oh !
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father .
I shall , therefore , set off to-morrow . '
'Have you , upon your honour ? '
Emma 's politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness : -- what must be at last , had better be soon .
Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .
The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again .
She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !
There was no getting at her real opinion .
She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the `` Oh !
`` She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford 's . ''
-- Ford 's was the principal woollen-draper , linen-draper , and haberdasher 's shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.
-- Dear Miss Woodhouse !
dear ; I was so miserable !
-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would .
-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all !
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !
-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's .
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
`` I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her .
I never saw any thing so outree !
-- This must be a fancy of her own .
I see nobody else looking like her !
-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ; -- whether she colours . ''
-- the manner of their coming ? ''
The more I think of it , the more probable it appears .
`` Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! ''
`` Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing ?
Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Towards the end of Jane's second song , her voice grew thick .
`` Perhaps it is as well , '' said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage .
`` I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after yours . ''
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill .
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
`` Do n't class us together , Harriet .
`` That you do not give another half-second to the subject .
This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .
He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Woodhouse , rather warmly , `` you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character .
`` What does all that signify ?
You will see nothing of it by candlelight .
We never see any thing of it on our club-nights . ''
He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .
She hardly knew what to say .
It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish .
Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .
What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
I have not forgotten it , I assure you.
-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
`` Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . ''
Surry is full of beauties . ''
I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together .
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general .
They are but too apt to give up music . ''
Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton .
Her observation had been pretty correct .
There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his wife .
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good-will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being `` very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . ''
`` I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , '' said Emma .
Emma returned her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,
Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again .
-- I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . ''
No invitation came amiss to her .
But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . ''
`` Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . ''
The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives .
When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . ''
If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . ''
`` Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , '' said Mr. Woodhouse ; `` and always did .
And so does poor Mrs. Weston '' -- with half a sigh and half a smile at her .
June will soon be here . ''
`` But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general . ''
my dear , human flesh !
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . ''
`` I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over .
He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize -- but there was great joy .
-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man 's house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
`` Read it , read it , '' said he , `` it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . ''
-- I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I ?
-- In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday .
This is precisely what I wanted .
Well , pretty good news , is not it ?
He had done his duty and could return to his son .
The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
`` He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . ''
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
-- He was thoughtful .
-- How do you like my trimming ?
-- How has Wright done my hair ? ''
Mrs. Elton then said , `` Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body's eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others .
-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
`` And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? ''
He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? ''
how could it be ?
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .
Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming.
-- Extraordinary dream , indeed ! ''
`` Miss Woodhouse , '' said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , `` have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
she cried in evident embarrassment , `` it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . ''
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .
Mrs. Elton 's resources were inadequate to such an attack .
But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ .
It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing .
Nothing can be more simple , you see .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , `` That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
-- You are fatigued already . ''
He said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said .
ma'am , but there may be a difficulty .
I undertake the commission .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
The most indefatigable , true friend .
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
-- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . ''
Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . ''
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
In one point she was fully justified .
The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
This moment , if you please .
To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
Emma even jumped with surprize ; -- and , horror-struck , exclaimed ,
`` What news do you mean ? ''
replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint .
`` You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?
Emma 's eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes .
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet 's having some hope of a return ?
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr .
-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.
-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr .
She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr. Knightley .
How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject !
-- Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life .
It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .
`` On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
'I did not make the allowances , ' said she , 'which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . '
She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . ''
It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete , on the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day ; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost.
`` You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.
-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion .
Emma could say no more .
She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
'Dearer , much dearer than ever . '
-- He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.
-- 'Happier than I deserve . '
-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
there is one difficulty unprovided for , '' cried Emma .
Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , `` Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell ?
no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting .
Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . ''
Emma 's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet 's being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
-- Do not you recollect ?
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .
-- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , `` Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .
I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you.
-- How -- how has it been possible ? ''
`` You ought to know your friend best , '' replied Mr. Knightley ; `` but I should say she was a good-tempered , soft-hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . ''
`` Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?
Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ?
I assured him that I could not .
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed .
Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite .
I wish we had a large acquaintance here . ''
`` As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . ''
`` Men commonly take so little notice of those things , '' said she ; `` I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another .
You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ''
I am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time .
`` I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her .
I must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly -- I am sure he is in love with you . ''
Nay , I can not blame you '' -- speaking more seriously -- '' your feelings are easily understood .
`` But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ''
`` Thank you , '' said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer .
`` I suppose you mean Camilla ? ''
John has charming spirits , has not he ? ''
This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment's consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , `` I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . ''
Lord , it would be the saving of thousands .
`` Yes , ma'am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . ''
`` Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? ''
That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self-condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself .
Her partner now drew near , and said , `` That gentleman would have put me out of patience , had he stayed with you half a minute longer .
I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage .
Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both ; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves , have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours . ''
`` Bath , compared with London , has little variety , and so everybody finds out every year .
`` Well , other people must judge for themselves , and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath .
Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers-on , immediately behind her partner .
Confused by his notice , and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance , she turned away her head .
It is General Tilney , my father . ''
At twelve o'clock , they were to call for her in Pulteney Street ; and `` Remember -- twelve o'clock , '' was her parting speech to her new friend .
You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? ''
I could not do it .
There has been no prior engagement . ''
I only go for the sake of driving you . ''
The business , however , though not perfectly elucidated by this speech , soon ceased to be a puzzle .
`` Thank you , Eleanor -- a most honourable testimony .
Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own .
I am fond of history -- and am very well contented to take the false with the true .
It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill , and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day .
She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance .
Where people wish to attach , they should always be ignorant .
To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others , which a sensible person would always wish to avoid .
A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can .
`` My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain .
The confusion there is scandalous .
Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy-six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern -- do you understand ?
The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . ''
`` For my own part , '' said Isabella , `` my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me .
A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy .
`` Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry .
`` But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ''
The evening rewarded her confidence ; she was met by one with the same kindness , and by the other with the same attention , as heretofore : Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance .
She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing .
His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible .
He can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen 's greatcoats , by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four , which will drive off with incredible speed .
`` No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ''
You bid me be surprised on your friend 's account , and therefore I am ; but as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to .
You have no disguise .
What can you have to do with hearts ?
`` Is it my brother 's attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe's admission of them , that gives the pain ? ''
But is not your father uncomfortable about it ?
Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ?
After being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage-house must be very disagreeable . ''
Will not your heart sink within you ? ''
`` No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ''
The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it .
Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror .
It was done completely ; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath .
A violent gust of wind , rising with sudden fury , added fresh horror to the moment .
A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes .
The storm too abroad so dreadful !
She had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence .
And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it !
But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene .
The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter .
Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep .
Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise .
The general listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour .
It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the general 's disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward .
He excused himself , however , from attending them : `` The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ''
He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation .
The breakfast-room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present .
On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step .
She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature .
-- in Miss Tilney 's meaning , in her own calculation !
This apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the general 's father had built .
There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing-closets ; but she had no inclination to open either .
She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble .
To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the general ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse !
She listened -- the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door .
She had no power to move .
With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view .
she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment .
`` Good God ! ''
`` How came you here ?
`` Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ''
I have heard of a faithful performance .
Large and cheerful-looking , and the dressing-closets so well disposed !
They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything .
The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did .
He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , `` Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it .
`` But he will tell only half of it . ''
Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him .
`` Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? ''
`` It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ''
His loss was not now what it had been while the general was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o'clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry's departure .
After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away , in a `` Good heaven !
And now -- what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ?
So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy !
Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation .
She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked-for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated -- though Mrs. Morland 's account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions .
`` She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house .
I need not tell you how much I miss him , how perpetually he is in my thoughts .
MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME
He had heard , I imagine , by some means or other , that you were soon to be in London , and immediately contrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay his journey to Bath , if not wholly prevent it .
I am persuaded the gout is brought on or kept off at pleasure ; it was the same when I wanted to join the Hamiltons to the Lakes ; and three years ago , when I had a fancy for Bath , nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom .
I have received your letter , and though I do not attempt to conceal that I am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting , I yet feel myself under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time originally fixed .
He has a right to require ; a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law , and I am sometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a connection so imprudent ; but the influence of reason is often acknowledged too late by those who feel like me .
It will surely , therefore , be advisable to delay our union -- to delay it till appearances are more promising -- till affairs have taken a more favourable turn .
To assist us In such a resolution I feel that absence will be necessary .
You may be -- you must be -- well assured that nothing but the strongest conviction of duty could induce me to wound my own feelings by urging a lengthened separation , and of insensibility to yours you will hardly suspect me .
By a removal for some months from each other we shall tranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon , who , accustomed herself to the enjoyment of riches , considers fortune as necessary everywhere , and whose sensibilities are not of a nature to comprehend ours .
Tell me that you submit to my arguments , and do not reproach me for using such .
Mr. De Courcy arrived just when he should not .
Facts are such horrid things !
All is by this time known to De Courcy , who is now alone with Mr. Johnson .
Mr. Johnson has for some time suspected De Courcy of intending to marry you , and would speak with him alone as soon as he knew him to be in the house .
At any rate , I hope he will plague his wife more than ever .
A week had passed in this way , and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner , when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund , the youngest of the sons , sitting crying on the attic stairs .
`` To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation .
He had a wife about fifteen years his junior , but no children ; and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very respectable , agreeable people .
`` I dare say you will .
These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies .
Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home .
And Fanny , what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while ?
and what was _her_ opinion of the newcomers ?
Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny .
The notice , which she excited herself , was to this effect .
It is ill placed .
`` I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it !
Post-captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _us_ .
Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny .
Edmund , who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole , returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward .
The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford 's great cleverness as a horse-woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own .
`` Yes , '' added Maria , `` and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character .
Edmund looked pleased , which must be Fanny 's comfort , and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning : the party included all the young people but herself , and was much enjoyed at the time , and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion .
A young party is always provided with a shady lane .
Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner , in shewing the Crawfords the country , and doing the honours of its finest spots .
Miss Bertram was the one .
She wished to be able to decline it ; but the tears , which a variety of feelings created , made it easier to swallow than to speak .
The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course .
Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . ''
`` If Edmund were but in orders ! ''
`` Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ''
`` No , indeed , far otherwise .
I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best .
And to tell you the truth , '' speaking rather lower , `` I do not think that _I_ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now .
`` More easily amused , '' he replied ; `` consequently , you know , '' smiling , `` better company .
Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ''
There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner .
That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure !
Take care of the cheese , Fanny .
`` It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister 's marriage , and your taking orders . ''
`` Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ?
But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument .
Fanny , it goes against us .
`` Yes , his manners to women are such as must please .
He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . ''
`` We have got a play , '' said he .
`` It is to be Lovers ' Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting-dress .
Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , `` I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and '' ( with a bolder eye ) `` Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ''
I can not but suppose you _will_ when you have read it carefully over .
It will not be necessary to send you to your _father's_ judgment , I am convinced . ''
`` _I_ shall not ask him , '' replied Tom , in a cold , determined manner .
`` No man can like being driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency .
Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her , she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria 's situation , or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself .
A glimpse , as she passed through the hall , of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat , and she worked and meditated in the East room , undisturbed , for a quarter of an hour , when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford .
But Fanny still hung back .
She could not endure the idea of it .
Or why had not she rather gone to her own room , as she had felt to be safest , instead of attending the rehearsal at all ?
Do have a basin of soup . ''
He stepped to the door , rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication , and , opening it , found himself on the stage of a theatre , and opposed to a ranting young man , who appeared likely to knock him down backwards .
At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas , and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals , Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room ; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance .
It would be the last -- in all probability -- the last scene on that stage ; but he was sure there could not be a finer .
It was impossible for many of the others not to smile .
Edmund 's first object the next morning was to see his father alone , and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme , defending his own share in it as far only as he could then , in a soberer moment , feel his motives to deserve , and acknowledging , with perfect ingenuousness , that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful .
`` Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ?
Go to my father if you want to be complimented .
He will satisfy you .
`` Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and I only wish you would talk to him more .
Miss Crawford 's kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance , and she began to talk of something else .
Fanny went to her every two or three days : it seemed a kind of fascination : she could not be easy without going , and yet it was without loving her , without ever thinking like her , without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had ; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement , and _that_ often at the expense of her judgment , when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected .
Edmund met them with particular pleasure .
A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished : and to the credit of the lover 's understanding , be it stated , that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only , or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship .
`` Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account .
`` _That_ is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on .
We will ask him .
`` Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ?
`` Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ?
Do not you see your aunt is going ?
You should always remember the coachman and horses .
My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ''
He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend 's letter , which claimed a long visit from her in London , and of the kindness of Henry , in engaging to remain where he was till January , that he might convey her thither ; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had `` no '' in every tone .
He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again .
No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed .
Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self-willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage .
Sir Thomas approved of it for another reason .
Upon the whole , it was a very joyous note .
said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy .
The time will never come .
I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had .
How many a time have we talked over her little errors !
`` Well , then , '' replied Miss Crawford , laughing , `` I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . ''
Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm `` Yes '' ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour 's silent consideration spontaneously observed , `` Sir Thomas , I have been thinking -- and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ''
If I _am_ missed , it will appear .
I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ''
He knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme .
The Admiral hated marriage , and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune .
The gentleness , modesty , and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on ; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman 's worth in the judgment of man , that though he sometimes loves where it is not , he can never believe it absent .
Was there one of the family , excepting Edmund , who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance ?
To see her with her brother !
What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view ?
Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife , though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name ; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct , such a high notion of honour , and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity , he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious .
Then we shall be all together . ''
Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , `` I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea .
I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again .
`` You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning .
I had not been long in my own room , after breakfast , when Mr. Crawford was shewn in .
His errand you may probably conjecture . ''
He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . ''
I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed .
For I _had_ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England .
I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self-conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence .
You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined .
How _they_ might be benefited , how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _you_ .
Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford's estate , or a tenth part of his merits .
Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia 's hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria 's to Mr .
I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding .
_You_ are not to be judged by the same rule .
Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged .
He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William 's promotion !
Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate !
The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford 's , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview .
It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go ; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words , or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself .
Fanny coloured , and doubted at first what to say ; when , hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side , she presently answered --
When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for .
`` She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man 's -- what 's his name , Fanny ?
`` No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , '' said Edmund , `` from one 's earliest years .
To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . ''
Her praise had been given in her attention ; _that_ must content them .
No theatre at Everingham !
`` Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny .
I had thought it might be a relief . ''
`` Do you suppose that we think differently ?
I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point -- I consider Crawford's proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection .
I will not tease you .
Everything shall take its course .
you received it just as it was meant .
You were as conscious as heart could desire .
Miss Crawford , _that_ was not fair . ''
When it came to the moment of parting , he would take her hand , he would not be denied it ; he said nothing , however , or nothing that she heard , and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed .
Edmund , too -- to be two months from _him_ ( and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three ) must do her good .
At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness .
What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become a slight evil at Portsmouth .
and now , what will you have ?
Betsey and I have been watching for you this half-hour .
We were better off in our last house .
There was great food for meditation in this letter , and chiefly for unpleasant meditation ; and yet , with all the uneasiness it supplied , it connected her with the absent , it told her of people and things about whom she had never felt so much curiosity as now , and she would have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week .
Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself , but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and alarmed her , and it was at least a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition so totally different from her own .
Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth .
She turned away , and wished he would not say such things .
She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wont to suppose .
Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father 's house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them .
After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford 's good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure .
This was a letter to be run through eagerly , to be read deliberately , to supply matter for much reflection , and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever .
The only certainty to be drawn from it was , that nothing decisive had yet taken place .
How Miss Crawford really felt , how she meant to act , or might act without or against her meaning ; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation ; whether , if lessened , it were likely to lessen more , or to recover itself , were subjects for endless conjecture , and to be thought of on that day and many days to come , without producing any conclusion .
The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up .
Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could , but she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind , both to her aunt and to herself .
`` There is no good in this delay , '' said she .
God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ''
`` 'So very fond of me ! '
't is nonsense all .
She is quite as likely to have led _them_ astray .
They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery .
'The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . '
'The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . '
Let there be an end of this suspense .
Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ''
This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants ' intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before .
Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions .
She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money .
`` A most scandalous , ill-natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country .
I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth 's folly .
He so near her , and in misery .
It made her melancholy again ; and the knowledge of what must be enduring there , invested even the house , modern , airy , and well situated as it was , with a melancholy aspect .
It had been a miserable party , each of the three believing themselves most miserable .
By her other aunt , Susan was received with quiet kindness .
Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny 's sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others .
They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject .
Sitting with her on Sunday evening -- a wet Sunday evening -- the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced .
And such was Fanny 's dependence on his words , that for five minutes she thought they _had_ done .
Then , however , it all came on again , or something very like it , and nothing less than Lady Bertram 's rousing thoroughly up could really close such a conversation .
Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother 's state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation .
This was not an agreeable intimation .
Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings , but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of ; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could -- it was too impossible to be named but with indignation .
Henry Crawford , ruined by early independence and bad domestic example , indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long .
Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman 's affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him .
He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them .
