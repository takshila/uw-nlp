The writing-table was splashed with old ink , and the pen disheveled in service .
There lay the gigantic gold-rimmed spectacles , ready to his hand , and beneath the table was a pair of large , worn slippers , one of which Katharine picked up , remarking :
`` Not if the visitors like them . ''
I 'll take Katharine Hilbery . ''
As soon as he had said this , his pace slackened , his head fell , his eyes became fixed .
It was marvellous how much they found to feed upon , considering the destructive nature of Denham 's criticism in her presence .
He was conscious of what he was about , for in thus dwelling upon Miss Hilbery's qualities , he showed a kind of method , as if he required this vision of her for a particular purpose .
`` They 're to bring my dinner up here , '' said Ralph , peremptorily ; whereupon she vanished , leaving the door ajar in her haste to be gone .
After Denham had waited some minutes , in the course of which neither he nor the rook took their eyes off the fire , he muttered a curse , ran downstairs , intercepted the parlor-maid , and cut himself a slice of bread and cold meat .
He reflected , with a growing sense of injury , that almost every one of his actions since opening the door of his room had been won from the grasp of the family system .
To dine alone , or to sit alone after dinner , was flat rebellion , to be fought with every weapon of underhand stealth or of open appeal .
Which did he dislike most -- deception or tears ?
But , at any rate , they could not rob him of his thoughts ; they could not make him say where he had been or whom he had seen .
That was his own affair ; that , indeed , was a step entirely in the right direction , and , lighting his pipe , and cutting up the remains of his meal for the benefit of the rook , Ralph calmed his rather excessive irritation and settled down to think over his prospects .
Ralph , as if he could foresee the length of this familiar argument , drew up a chair for his sister and sat down himself .
She wondered what it might be , but at once recalled her mind , and assented .
She , too , was becoming annoyed .
She had spent the whole of the afternoon discussing wearisome details of education and expense with her mother , and she had come to her brother for help , encouraged , rather irrationally , to expect help by the fact that he had been out somewhere , she did n't know and did n't mean to ask where , all the afternoon .
It was out of the question that she should put any more household work upon herself .
He believed secretly and rather defiantly , for it was a fact not capable of proof , that there was something very remarkable about his family .
`` You really ca n't expect her to sell out again . ''
`` I think you 'd be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles , '' she observed .
Besides , why should you be sacrificed ? ''
A slight flush came into Joan 's cheek .
Why , he wondered , could Joan never for one moment detach her mind from the details of domestic life ?
It seemed to him that she was getting more and more enmeshed in them , and capable of shorter and less frequent flights into the outer world , and yet she was only thirty-three .
Why do you ask ? ''
And if this is true of the sons , even the daughters , even in the nineteenth century , are apt to become people of importance -- philanthropists and educationalists if they are spinsters , and the wives of distinguished men if they marry .
It is true that there were several lamentable exceptions to this rule in the Alardyce group , which seems to indicate that the cadets of such houses go more rapidly to the bad than the children of ordinary fathers and mothers , as if it were somehow a relief to them .
One finds them at the tops of professions , with letters after their names ; they sit in luxurious public offices , with private secretaries attached to them ; they write solid books in dark covers , issued by the presses of the two great universities , and when one of them dies the chances are that another of them writes his biography .
Besides , it must be established indisputably that her grandfather was a very great man .
`` And here we are , '' she said , half aloud , half satirically , yet with evident pride , `` talking about art . ''
I expect a good solid paper , with plenty of quotations from the classics . ''
The only thing that 's odd about me is that I enjoy them both -- Emerson and the stocking . ''
`` There 'll be the Morrises and the Crashaws , and Dick Osborne , and Septimus , and all that set .
I only felt that she was n't very sympathetic to me . ''
She looked round quickly , recognized about half a dozen people , to whom she nodded , but failed to see Ralph , or , if so , had already forgotten to attach any name to him .
But in a second these heterogeneous elements were all united by the voice of Mr. Rodney , who suddenly strode up to the table , and began very rapidly in high-strained tones :
They 'd only laugh at me .
`` Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace ? ''
The three of them stood for a moment awkwardly silent , and then Mary left them in order to see that the great pitcher of coffee was properly handled , for beneath all her education she preserved the anxieties of one who owns china .
Not for you only , but for all women .
That is why -- '' Here he stopped himself , and they began to walk slowly along the Embankment , the moon fronting them .
`` There 's more of the old maid in you than the poet , '' she observed briefly .
One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine .
They had reached a small court of high eighteenth-century houses , in one of which Rodney had his rooms .
They climbed a very steep staircase , through whose uncurtained windows the moonlight fell , illuminating the banisters with their twisted pillars , and the piles of plates set on the window-sills , and jars half-full of milk .
Rodney 's rooms were small , but the sitting-room window looked out into a courtyard , with its flagged pavement , and its single tree , and across to the flat red-brick fronts of the opposite houses , which would not have surprised Dr. Johnson , if he had come out of his grave for a turn in the moonlight .
`` I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare , '' Rodney remarked .
Denham took the manuscript and went .
From sheer laziness he returned no thanks , but he thought of Rodney from time to time with interest , disconnecting him from Katharine , and meant to go round one evening and smoke a pipe with him .
It pleased Rodney thus to give away whatever his friends genuinely admired .
She sat herself down to her letters , and very soon all these speculations were forgotten , and the two lines drew themselves between her eyebrows , as the contents of the letters , the office furniture , and the sounds of activity in the next room gradually asserted their sway upon her .
By eleven o'clock the atmosphere of concentration was running so strongly in one direction that any thought of a different order could hardly have survived its birth more than a moment or so .
It was her first attempt at organization on a large scale , and she meant to achieve something remarkable .
She touched the bell , and the door was opened almost immediately by Mary herself .
`` No , I 'm afraid I do n't , '' said Katharine , with such ready candor that Mrs. Seal was nonplussed , and stared at her with a puzzled expression , as if she could not classify her among the varieties of human beings known to her .
Katharine had risen , and was glancing hither and thither , at the presses and the cupboards , and all the machinery of the office , as if she included them all in her rather malicious amusement , which caused Mary to keep her eyes on her straightly and rather fiercely , as if she were a gay-plumed , mischievous bird , who might light on the topmost bough and pick off the ruddiest cherry , without any warning .
Two women less like each other could scarcely be imagined , Ralph thought , looking from one to the other .
`` I 've planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child , to make it last longer .
Directly the door opened he closed the book , and the eyes of father and mother both rested on Katharine as she came towards them .
The sight seemed at once to give them a motive which they had not had before .
To them she appeared , as she walked towards them in her light evening dress , extremely young , and the sight of her refreshed them , were it only because her youth and ignorance made their knowledge of the world of some value .
From the surrounding walls the heads of three famous Victorian writers surveyed this entertainment , and slips of paper pasted beneath them testified in the great man 's own handwriting that he was yours sincerely or affectionately or for ever .
`` That 's only because she is his mother .
`` Who 's been talking to you about poetry , Katharine ? ''
They show up the faults of one 's cause so much more plainly than one's antagonists .
So I 've always found , '' and he proceeded to tell them , as he peeled his apple , how he committed himself once , in his youthful days , to make a speech at a political meeting , and went there ablaze with enthusiasm for the ideals of his own side ; but while his leaders spoke , he became gradually converted to the other way of thinking , if thinking it could be called , and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a fool of himself -- an experience which had sickened him of public meetings .
`` But the marriage ? ''
`` Besides , '' she said , giving the sheet she had written to Katharine , `` I do n't believe this 'll do .
Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a chapter .
From exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the imagination of her death aroused .
The depression communicated itself to Katharine .
Of course , Katharine reflected , her mother had now lost some paper , and they would waste the rest of the morning looking for it .
We 're virtuous , we 're earnest , we go to meetings , we pay the poor their wages , but we do n't live as they lived .
Mrs. Hilbery looked from one to the other in bewilderment .
But with Ralph , if he broke away , she knew that it would be only to put himself under harsher constraint ; she figured him toiling through sandy deserts under a tropical sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some fly ; she figured him living by the labor of his hands in some city slum , the victim of one of those terrible theories of right and wrong which were current at the time ; she figured him prisoner for life in the house of a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes .
For a moment they were both silent .
`` And I wonder , '' William proceeded , with some caution , `` what the truth about you is ?
`` No ; it does n't interest me very much , '' she replied candidly .
On such occasions his eyes protruded more than ever , and his face had more than ever the appearance of being covered with a thin crackling skin , through which every flush of his volatile blood showed itself instantly .
Let me see now , what have I got to show you ? ''
He rose , and stirred about the papers on his table , as if in doubt ; he then picked up a manuscript , and after spreading it smoothly upon his knee , he looked up at Katharine suspiciously .
His mastery of meters was very great ; and , if the beauty of a drama depended upon the variety of measures in which the personages speak , Rodney 's plays must have challenged the works of Shakespeare .
No one could doubt that William was a scholar .
And now I 've written this , it comes over me that , of course , all the time , Katharine has what he has n't .
It 's time that she should give all this to some one who will need her when we are n't there , save in our spirits , for whatever people say , I 'm sure I shall come back to this wonderful world where one's been so happy and so miserable , where , even now , I seem to see myself stretching out my hands for another present from the great Fairy Tree whose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys , though they are rarer now , perhaps , and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky , but the stars and the tops of the mountains .
It might have been due merely to politeness , but Ralph felt that she received him almost with cordiality .
And she overflowed the edges of the dream ; he remarked that her softness was like that of some vast snowy owl ; she wore a ruby on her finger .
It would be easy , Ralph thought , to worship one so far removed , and yet of so straight a nature ; easy to submit recklessly to her , without thought of future pain .
Denham 's one wish was to leave the house as soon as he could ; but the elderly ladies had risen , and were proposing to visit Mrs. Hilbery in her bedroom , so that any move on his part was impossible .
At the same time , he wished to say something , but he knew not what , to Katharine alone .
Now Denham had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep alive a fine anger when he chose .
Rodney provided a good target for that emotion .
And yet at the moment , Rodney and Katharine herself seemed disembodied ghosts .
He could scarcely remember the look of them .
His mind plunged lower and lower .
But life is vigorous ; the body lives , and the body , no doubt , dictated the reflection , which now urged him to movement , that one may cast away the forms of human beings , and yet retain the passion which seemed inseparable from their existence in the flesh .
His eyes were set on something infinitely far and remote ; by that light he felt he could walk , and would , in future , have to find his way .
But that was all there was left to him of a populous and teeming world .
He thought that these winter days were spent in long hours before white papers radiant in electric light ; and in short passages through fog-dimmed streets .
If we keep perfectly still , I 'll get one to settle on my arm . ''
Mary made no answer to this remark , but frowned .
He spoke without much vehemence of agreement or disagreement .
Mary cried , turning and pinching his sleeve .
She really did not know what he had meant .
She never felt quite certain ; but now she was more than usually baffled .
Moreover , she could not prevent herself from doing now what she had often blamed others of her sex for doing -- from endowing her friend with a kind of heavenly fire , and passing her life before it for his sanction .
You see that wicked men do n't break into her larder when she 's out at HER work -- helping poor souls who have lost their way ... .
and scattering the rest of the water indiscriminately over the floor , she hurried Mary into the committee-room .
She had sat there for five minutes or so , and her thoughts had had time to grow dim , when there came a ring at her bell .
Accordingly , she waited a moment before opening the door ; she wanted to feel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions which the sight of Ralph would certainly arouse .
Her first impression was that they were both extremely well dressed .
She felt herself shabby and slovenly beside them , and did not know how she should entertain them , nor could she guess why they had come .
She had heard nothing of their engagement .
`` Will you come out shooting with us to-morrow ? ''
said Christopher , who had , on the whole , formed a favorable impression of his sister 's friend .
I want to have a house of my own .
You would n't be happy either , if you did n't do something .
`` Perhaps marriage will make you more human . ''
`` Well , if you believe that your life must be simple , Henry . ''
He was in love with Katharine , and vanity is not decreased but increased by love ; especially , one may hazard , in the presence of one 's own sex .
He chose a cigarette , tapped it on the back of his hand , displayed his exquisite pumps on the edge of the fender , and summoned his self-respect .
`` Yes -- but now what direction d'you think they take ? ''
`` No , '' said Henry .
`` I think you 're right , '' he added , as if he were summing up his thoughts .
Life is n't altogether real to her yet -- I sometimes think -- ''
In truth , Sir Francis had retired from service under the Government of India with a pension that was not adequate , in his opinion , to his services , as it certainly was not adequate to his ambitions .
His career had not come up to his expectations , and although he was a very fine , white-whiskered , mahogany-colored old man to look at , and had laid down a very choice cellar of good reading and good stories , you could not long remain ignorant of the fact that some thunder-storm had soured them ; he had a grievance .
`` I 'm on my way to the library , and I do n't want to interrupt .
The presence of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy .
`` Marriage , '' said Mrs. Hilbery , coming into the room , and nodding her head once or twice , `` I always say marriage is a school .
Charlotte has won all the prizes , '' she added , giving her sister-in-law a little pat , which made Lady Otway more uncomfortable still .
She still waited , as if for him to continue ; she was convinced that in some roundabout way he approached the subject of their marriage .
Some six weeks separated him from that afternoon when he had sat upon the Embankment watching his visions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense of his desolation still made him shiver .
I like bossing things -- perhaps that 's my greatest fault .
I 've none of your passion for -- '' here she hesitated , and glanced at him , as if to ascertain what his passion was for -- '' for the truth , '' she added , as if she had found what she sought indisputably .
He did not succeed in saying anything .
He was struck dumb by finding that Katharine was quite different , in some strange way , from his memory , so that he had to dismiss his old view in order to accept the new one .
She half smiled at Ralph , but her look was a little overcast by something she was thinking , and in a very few minutes the Otway carriage rolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high road leading to the village of Lampsher .
As usual , she had quickened her pace unconsciously , and was now walking a little in front of him ; but he could gain little information from her eyes , which looked steadily at the brown heather , or from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead .
Thus to lose touch with her , for he had no idea what she was thinking , was so unpleasant to him that he began to talk about his grievances again , without , however , much conviction in his voice .
`` If you have no feeling for me , would n't it be kinder to say so to me in private ? ''
`` Believe me , Katharine , before we came here we were perfectly happy .
You were full of plans for our house -- the chair-covers , do n't you remember ?
At one time I was always asking myself absurd questions which came to nothing either .
If it had n't been for my poetry , I assure you , I should often have been very much in the same state myself .
`` You could n't do it ? ''
`` You do n't mean that you 're going to leave us ? ''
But reason , '' she reflected , `` what is reason without Reality ? ''
`` Why ca n't they leave me alone ? ''
And , as she smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript , she braced herself to resist Katharine , whose presence struck her , not merely by its force , as usual , but as something in the nature of a menace .
`` Yes , because he would do something worth while ; he would write a book .
`` She sat up straight and looked at me , and then she said , 'I 'm in love , ' '' Katharine mused , trying to set the whole scene in motion .
She made up her mind to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained , and cast her mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath , when she had yielded , heaven knows why , for reasons which seemed now imperceptible .
The thought , implying his bondage to her , irritated him acutely .
Possibly , but not by any means certainly , this would annoy her -- and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion , there was a knock on the door and Katharine came in .
He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates .
But the light which had been burning with such intensity as she came along was suddenly overclouded , as much by his manner as by his news .
The meal passed in quiet , well-controlled talk about indifferent things .
The atmosphere was very free .
Suddenly William broke off .
`` You 've been neglecting my education lately , by the way .
I wish you 'd read something .
So speaking , she went across to his bookshelves and began looking in a desultory way among his books .
Anything , she thought , was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the distance between them .
She did not know what was going to happen next .
It was , perhaps , the first time in all her knowledge of him that Katharine had known William enter thus deliberately and without sign of emotion upon a statement of his own feelings .
He was wont to discourage such intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn of the conversation , as much as to say that men , or men of the world , find such topics a little silly , or in doubtful taste .
His remarks interested her too much for the light that they threw upon certain problems of her own .
`` My dear Katharine ! ''
He was covered with an extreme confusion .
But a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing him that his mind , when looked at from within , was no longer familiar ground .
He had never felt anything like this before ; he put himself entirely into her hands ; he cast off all responsibility .
`` You 've stirred up all these odious and violent emotions , and now you must do the best you can with them . ''
After a moment of surprising anguish , she summoned her courage to tell him how she wished only that she might help him , and had framed the first words of her speech when a knock , terrific and startling to people in their overwrought condition , sounded upon the door .
`` Katharine , I worship you , '' he urged , half in a whisper .
But you won't cut yourself off altogether , surely -- ''
`` There seem to be no cabs .
But it 's spring ; it's the daffodils ; it 's the green fields ; it 's the birds . ''
`` He 's coming to tea . ''
With this to humiliate there was much to exalt .
She had a fantastic picture of them upholding splendid palaces upon their bent backs .
Half forming such conceptions as these in her rapid walk along the dreary streets of South Kensington , she determined that , whatever else might be obscure , she must further the objects of Mary , Denham , William , and Cassandra .
The way was not apparent .
But when he reached his office his torments began .
Did n't the letter show the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality , all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness , which flitted , for the rest of the morning , as a will-o'-the-wisp , across Rodney 's landscape .
He found it particularly delightful to shape a style which should express the bowing and curtsying , advancing and retreating , which are characteristic of one of the many million partnerships of men and women .
It was all very well to dress oneself carefully , compose one 's face , and start off punctually at half-past four to a tea-party in Cheyne Walk , but Heaven only knew what would come of it all , and when Katharine , after sitting silent with her usual immobility , wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table beneath his eyes a letter addressed to Cassandra herself , his composure deserted him .
Directly he left her she would go to her mother , and explain that the engagement was at an end -- or it might be better that they should go together ?
`` I 've left my bag somewhere -- where ? ''
The gardens had no points of the compass , so far as she was concerned .
She had been walking for the most part on grass -- that was all she knew .
What did this bag look like ?
`` My notion of perfect happiness , '' he began , not replying to her question , `` is to live as you 've said . ''
`` Are you working ? ''
If you do n't want a mutual admiration society , which dies as soon as you 've all discovered each other 's faults , you must nobble the Press .
You must appeal to the public . ''
Unfortunately for her composure , Mr. Basnett and his papers seemed to her an incidental diversion of life's serious purpose compared with some tremendous fact which manifested itself as she stood alone with Katharine .
`` I believe I 'm jealous , '' said Mary .
Without either of them wishing it , a feeling of hostility had risen between them .
`` One of Katharine 's friends , '' he said rather sharply .
The center was one of intense and curious emotion .
`` I do n't know whether you and Denham would care to join us . ''
As they listened to the shaking of the bell in the basement , she could summon no vision to replace the one so rudely destroyed .
`` Have you many brothers and sisters ? ''
`` Six or seven , '' he replied grimly , as the door opened .
She was thinking of their argument , and when , after the long climb , he opened his door , she began at once .
`` I thought you disliked me , '' she said .
`` No , '' Ralph replied .
She did not press him further .
She spoke in the most impersonal manner .
`` But she 's engaged -- ''
They looked at each other , queerly , in the light of the lamp .
For the moment , under the lamp-post , they seemed to be aware of some common knowledge which did away with the possibility of rivalry , and made them feel more sympathy for each other than for any one else in the world .
Giving simultaneously a little nod , as if in confirmation of this understanding , they parted without speaking again .
`` No , '' Cassandra allowed once more .
She was completely at a loss .
In her forecast of the interview she had taken it for granted that Katharine , after an outburst of incredulity , would agree that Cassandra must return home as soon as possible .
But Katharine , on the contrary , accepted her statement at once , seemed neither shocked nor surprised , and merely looked rather more thoughtful than usual .
From being a mature woman charged with an important mission , Cassandra shrunk to the stature of an inexperienced child .
`` He may be in love with you . ''
`` Please , miss , '' said the maid , about eleven o'clock on the following morning , `` Mrs. Milvain is in the kitchen . ''
William slowly raised himself .
The thrill of excitement associated with the thought of Cassandra once more took possession of him .
No longer was it the excitement of anticipation and ignorance ; it was the excitement of something greater than a possibility , for now he knew her and had measure of the sympathy between them .
But who could give him certainty ?
Could Katharine , Katharine who had lately lain in his arms , Katharine herself the most admired of women ?
He walked up and down the room ; he paused at the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor .
Meanwhile his desire to have Katharine 's assurance confirmed became so insistent that he could no longer deny the overmastering strength of his feeling for Cassandra .
`` I ca n't share him even with you . ''
she asked , as soon as the door was shut .
`` After what you 've said , I can hardly trust you -- unless you 'll unsay what you 've said ? ''
One can be in love with pure reason ? ''
But I think I do know a little about poetry , '' she added .
The writing-table might have belonged to a professional man of methodical habits .
`` Here 's your Macaulay , '' said Katharine , turning round with the book in her hand .
`` I should say you 'd better begin to read at once if you mean to be educated by tea-time . ''
Katharine had been telephoning to Ralph Denham ; she looked queer , too ; she must be , or about to become , engaged to him .
But if Cassandra could have overheard the conversation upon the telephone , she would not have felt so certain that it tended in that direction .
`` My dear child , after what I saw and heard last night , it 's not a question of guessing or suspecting .
`` Well , she IS queer ! ''
They ran to the window , and saw her walking rapidly along the street towards the City .
The half-hour was not quite spent .
You 'll see him another day . ''
Mary spoke , and intended to speak , cruelly enough .
Katharine vanished from Mary 's sight .
`` We have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish ... '' or , `` We must leave time to visit the Maze . ''
There were moments when she felt so young and inexperienced that she almost wished herself back with the silkworms at Stogdon House , and not embarked upon this bewildering intrigue .
`` His father has been dead some time , and this young man had to take his place -- ''
Mrs. Milvain became rigid , and emitted her message in little short sentences of extreme intensity .
Who has Katharine gone out with ?
Why are they for ever meeting each other round street corners , and going to music-halls , and taking cabs late at night ?
Katharine has entangled herself with this unknown lawyer ; she has seen fit to condone Cassandra 's conduct . ''
Katharine spoke hurriedly and indifferently , as if the matter could no longer concern any one .
He nodded his head , as if to convey his silent command to her to leave the room ; but either she did not notice it or preferred not to obey .
`` You have the impudence -- '' Mr. Hilbery began , in a dull , low voice that he himself had never heard before , when there was a scuffling and exclaiming in the hall , and Cassandra , who appeared to be insisting against some dissuasion on the part of another , burst into the room .
They could hear her immediately speak to some one outside , though the words were inaudible .
`` No , '' she replied .
I did n't want your father to tell me .
`` It 's all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays , if you think the Church service a little florid -- which it is , though there are noble things in it . ''
`` Yes , tell me what you felt . ''
`` We have to have faith in our vision , '' Mrs. Hilbery resumed , glancing at the figures , which distressed her vaguely , and had some connection in her mind with the household accounts , `` otherwise , as you say -- '' She cast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment which were , perhaps , not altogether unknown to her .
She took them to the drawing-room .
Nor was she unconscious that on the surface the whole thing must appear of the utmost absurdity .
She looked to see whether Ralph smiled , but found his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the belief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself , perhaps immeasurably , perhaps eternally .
But his glance seemed to ask for some assurance upon another point of vital interest to him .
It beseeched her mutely to tell him whether what she had read upon his confused sheet had any meaning or truth to her .
Cassandra was so glad that the tears ran down her cheeks .
The certainty of Katharine 's engagement not only relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self-reproaches , but entirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately impaired her belief in Katharine .
Next moment she contrasted her own lot with theirs and gave back the ring .
The lamps were lit ; their luster reflected itself in the polished wood ; good wine was passed round the dinner-table ; before the meal was far advanced civilization had triumphed , and Mr. Hilbery presided over a feast which came to wear more and more surely an aspect , cheerful , dignified , promising well for the future .
To judge from the expression in Katharine 's eyes it promised something -- but he checked the approach sentimentality .
`` As you like , '' she replied .
`` I shall say something ridiculous -- something about flames -- fires .
There was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard , which I was about to administer when she recovered her composure .
`` But what has that got to do with it ? ''
`` Ladies , we must try to sum up the results , '' Jane was beginning , when a hum , which had been heard for some time through the open window , drowned her voice .
But with my eyes upon life I did not see that the other travellers had left , one by one , till , save for the man who read , we were alone together .
We drew slowly down the platform and stopped .
I prayed both ways -- I prayed last that he might stay .
At that instant he roused himself , crumpled his paper contemptuously , like a thing done with , burst open the door , and left us alone .
But we 're brushing the crumbs off .
Oh , Moggridge , you wo n't stay ?
You must be off ?
Are you driving through Eastbourne this afternoon in one of those little carriages ?
She is brushing the eggshell into deep declivities ) .
She said it certainly , leaning against the wall of the bedroom , and plucking at the little balls which edge the claret-coloured curtain .
But when the self speaks to the self , who is speaking ?
`` That man at lunch -- Hilda -- the children . ''
It 's the spirit wailing its destiny , the spirit driven hither , thither , lodging on the diminishing carpets -- meagre footholds -- shrunken shreds of all the vanishing universe -- love , life , faith , husband , children , I know not what splendours and pageantries glimpsed in girlhood .
He said he 'd meet me ... .
`` The last time in Venice . ''
On the contrary , it seems to me pretty sure that she , whoever she may be , is damned , since it 's all a matter of flats and hats and sea gulls , or so it seems to be for a hundred people sitting here well dressed , walled in , furred , replete .
Not that I can boast , since I too sit passive on a gilt chair , only turning the earth above a buried memory , as we all do , for there are signs , if I 'm not mistaken , that we 're all recalling something , furtively seeking something .
Why so anxious about the sit of cloaks ; and gloves -- whether to button or unbutton ?
The pear tree on the top of the mountain .
Also in jolly old fishwives , squatted under arches , obscene old women , how deeply they laugh and shake and rollick , when they walk , from side to side , hum , hah !
You go this way ? ''
`` Fifteen years ago I came here with Lily , '' he thought .
`` We sat somewhere over there by a lake and I begged her to marry me all through the hot afternoon .
All the time I spoke I saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently I knew without looking up what she was going to say : the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe .
And my love , my desire , were in the dragonfly ; for some reason I thought that if it settled there , on that leaf , the broad one with the red flower in the middle of it , if the dragonfly settled on the leaf she would say `` Yes '' at once .
But the dragonfly went round and round : it never settled anywhere -- of course not , happily not , or I should n't be walking here with Eleanor and the children -- Tell me , Eleanor .
D'you ever think of the past ? ''
Sugar , flour , kippers , greens , Sugar , sugar , sugar . ''
she asked with the oddest thrill of excitement in her voice , looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn on down the grass path , trailing her parasol , turning her head this way and that way , forgetting her tea , wishing to go down there and then down there , remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers , a Chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird ; but he bore her on .
But as for that mark , I 'm not sure about it ; I do n't believe it was made by a nail after all ; it 's too big , too round , for that .
The ignorance of humanity !
What a scraping paring affair it is to be sure !
Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked !
Yes , that seems to express the rapidity of life , the perpetual waste and repair ; all so casual , all so haphazard ... .
Mrs. Flanders whispered , and Rebecca nodded and went to the cot and turned down the quilt , and Mrs. Flanders bent over and looked anxiously at the baby , asleep , but frowning .
The light blazed out across the patch of grass ; fell on the child's green bucket with the gold line round it , and upon the aster which trembled violently beside it .
So that was a reason for going down into the Aquarium , where the sallow blinds , the stale smell of spirits of salt , the bamboo chairs , the tables with ash-trays , the revolving fish , the attendant knitting behind six or seven chocolate boxes ( often she was quite alone with the fish for hours at a time ) remained in the mind as part of the monster shark , he himself being only a flabby yellow receptacle , like an empty Gladstone bag in a tank .
It changes ; drapes her ankles -- the nineties ; then it amplifies -- the seventies ; now it 's burnished red and stretched above a crinoline -- the sixties ; a tiny black foot wearing a white cotton stocking peeps out .
The silk now is sprigged with roses , but somehow one no longer sees so clearly .
Mrs. Flanders sat on the raised circle of the Roman camp , patching Jacob 's breeches ; only looking up as she sucked the end of her cotton , or when some insect dashed at her , boomed in her ear , and was gone .
Archer chose a paper-knife , because he did not like to choose anything too good ; Jacob chose the works of Byron in one volume ; John , who was still too young to make a proper choice , chose Mr. Floyd's kitten , which his brothers thought an absurd choice , but Mr. Floyd upheld him when he said : `` It has fur like you . ''
Mrs. Flanders got up and went over to the fender and stroked Topaz on the neck behind the ears .
The upper wings of the moth which Jacob held were undoubtedly marked with kidney-shaped spots of a fulvous hue .
But there was no crescent upon the underwing .
The only one of her sons who never obeyed her , she said .
It fell like an eye upon the stirrups , and then suddenly and yet very gently rested upon the bed , upon the alarum clock , and upon the butterfly box stood open .
The pale clouded yellows had pelted over the moor ; they had zigzagged across the purple clover .
An old cottage woman living alone , high up , had told him of a purple butterfly which came every summer to her garden .
The fox cubs played in the gorse in the early morning , she told him .
`` Oh-h-h-h , '' groaned Jacob , as the boat rocked , and the trees rocked , and the white dresses and the white flannel trousers drew out long and wavering up the bank .
One supposed that young men raised their eyes from their books as the furniture fell .
There were young men who read , lying in shallow arm-chairs , holding their books as if they had hold in their hands of something that would see them through ; they being all in a torment , coming from midland towns , clergymen 's sons .
And those long histories in many volumes -- surely some one was now beginning at the beginning in order to understand the Holy Roman Empire , as one must .
That was part of the concentration , though it would be dangerous on a hot spring night -- dangerous , perhaps , to concentrate too much upon single books , actual chapters , when at any moment the door opened and Jacob appeared ; or Richard Bonamy , reading Keats no longer , began making long pink spills from an old newspaper , bending forward , and looking eager and contented no more , but almost fierce .
Only perhaps that Keats died young -- one wants to write poetry too and to love -- oh , the brutes !
There was a sofa , chairs , a square table , and the window being open , one could see how they sat -- legs issuing here , one there crumpled in a corner of the sofa ; and , presumably , for you could not see him , somebody stood by the fender , talking .
`` Somehow it seems to matter . ''
`` His sister , '' said Timmy , `` is a very pretty girl . ''
Mrs. Durrant sat in the drawing-room by a lamp winding a ball of wool .
Mr. Wortley read a book .
`` Oh , Miss Durrant , '' he said , taking the basket of grapes ; but she walked past him towards the door of the greenhouse .
( `` The truth is one ought to have been taught French .
That 's an odd affair to be sure .
) for the market carts were lumbering down the street .
`` There 's St .
They drank coffee at a stall where the urns were burnished and little lamps burnt along the counter .
At this moment there shook out into the air a wavering , quavering , doleful lamentation which seemed to lack strength to unfold itself , and yet flagged on ; at the sound of which doors in back streets burst sullenly open ; workmen stumped forth .
`` Well , you see what makes her say things like that is ... ''
Effusively she thanked him ; retraced her steps ; dropped her glove again .
`` I do n't like you when you look like that , '' said Florinda .
But when she looked at him , dumbly , half-guessing , half-understanding , apologizing perhaps , anyhow saying as he had said , `` It 's none of my fault , '' straight and beautiful in body , her face like a shell within its cap , then he knew that cloisters and classics are no use whatever .
Mr. Calthorp , let me introduce you to Miss Edwards . ''
... `` Your tea , sir. ''
The door was shut ; and to suppose that wood , when it creaks , transmits anything save that rats are busy and wood dry is childish .
Better , perhaps , burst in and face it than sit in the antechamber listening to the little creak , the sudden stir , for her heart was swollen , and pain threaded it .
The Prime Minister 's speech was reported in something over five columns .
Feeling in his pocket , Jacob took out a pipe and proceeded to fill it .
He was certainly thinking about Home Rule in Ireland -- a very difficult matter .
She got up gracefully , calmly .
Nobody laughed in the reading-room .
The lesson hour was almost over .
Her hair flew ; pins seemed scarcely to attach the flying silks .
An actress of course , a line of light perpetually beneath her .
And down she tumbled on the floor , and sang , since there was nothing to be said , round ah's and oh 's .
She was on her way to sit to Nick Bramham the painter .
All the men are busy in the town .
The eyes of all the nurses , mothers , and wandering women are a little glazed , absorbed .
They gently nod instead of answering when the little boys tug at their skirts , begging them to move on .
Large coffee and crumpets .
Two fruit cakes . ''
Feasted upon by the eyes of women , the clothes by four o'clock were flyblown like sugar cakes in a baker 's window .
Nick never read books , never talked of Ireland , or the House of Lords ; and as for his finger-nails !
She had read Scott ; she had read Dumas .
They are real , thought Fanny Elmer , setting her feet on the mantelpiece .
And women never -- except Miss Sargent , but she went off at lunch-time and gave herself airs .
`` I do like Tom Jones , '' said Fanny , at five-thirty that same day early in April when Jacob took out his pipe in the arm-chair opposite .
`` In Paris ? ''
Mrs. Flanders rubbed the turf with her toe , thinking of her garnet brooch .
Was Mrs. Flanders's twopenny-halfpenny brooch for ever part of the rich accumulation ?
A fox pads stealthily .
A leaf turns on its edge .
Evan joined them on the road ; and as they drove along up hill and down hill ( for Greece is in a state of effervescence , yet astonishingly clean-cut , a treeless land , where you see the ground between the blades , each hill cut and shaped and outlined as often as not against sparkling deep blue waters , islands white as sand floating on the horizon , occasional groves of palm trees standing in the valleys , which are scattered with black goats , spotted with little olive trees and sometimes have white hollows , rayed and criss-crossed , in their flanks ) , as they drove up hill and down he scowled in the corner of the carriage , with his paw so tightly closed that the skin was stretched between the knuckles and the little hairs stood upright .
`` That young man , Jacob Flanders , '' they would say , `` so distinguished looking -- and yet so awkward . ''
`` But you should see the Parthenon in the day-time , '' he said .
Far away on the horizon she discerned it and could not rest .
Tell me everything . ''
It was dark now over Athens , except for gauzy red streaks where the streets ran ; and the front of the Palace was cadaverous from electric light .
Oh , here was Mrs. Cowley Johnson ...
Florinda looked at it with a dull expression , like an animal .
The door opened ; in came the roar of Regent Street , the roar of traffic , impersonal , unpitying ; and sunshine grained with dirt .
`` The way he stares . ''
You can stick to it .
His head -- bald , red-veined , hollow-looking -- represented all the heads in the building .
`` One does not die of it , at any rate , '' said Helen .
`` There 's an unmarried daughter who keeps house for him , I believe , but it 's never the same , not at his age . ''
`` There _was_ a book , but there never _will_ be a book , '' said Mr. Pepper with such fierceness that both ladies looked up at him .
`` There never will be a book , because some one else has written it for him , '' said Mr. Pepper with considerable acidity .
Still holding Helen 's hand he drew his arm round Rachel 's shoulder , thus making them come uncomfortably close , but Helen forbore to look .
`` If it were n't for the goats there 'd be no music , my dear ; music depends upon goats , '' said her father rather sharply , and Mr. Pepper went on to describe the white , hairless , blind monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea , which would explode if you brought them to the surface , their sides bursting asunder and scattering entrails to the winds when released from pressure , with considerable detail and with such show of knowledge , that Ridley was disgusted , and begged him to stop .
`` And now you 've chewed something thirty-seven times , I suppose ? ''
she thought , but said politely aloud , `` Are your legs troubling you to-day , Mr .
If ever Miss Rachel marries , Chailey , pray that she may marry a man who does n't know his ABC . ''
The rest were occupied in other parts of the ship : Ridley at his Greek -- he had never found quarters more to his liking ; Willoughby at his documents , for he used a voyage to work of arrears of business ; and Rachel -- Helen , between her sentences of philosophy , wondered sometimes what Rachel _did_ do with herself ?
She meant vaguely to go and see .
The conclusion was very welcome .
Let these odd men and women -- her aunts , the Hunts , Ridley , Helen , Mr. Pepper , and the rest -- be symbols , -- featureless but dignified , symbols of age , of youth , of motherhood , of learning , and beautiful often as people upon the stage are beautiful .
112 , even with the spirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney .
They got round poor little Jackson anyhow .
She was absorbed in her arrangements , and on seeing Rachel remarked confidentially :
she asked , not knowing exactly what to say .
`` When I 'm with artists I feel so intensely the delights of shutting oneself up in a little world of one 's own , with pictures and music and everything beautiful , and then I go out into the streets and the first child I meet with its poor , hungry , dirty little face makes me turn round and say , 'No , I _can't_ shut myself up -- I _won't_ live in a world of my own .
I should like to stop all the painting and writing and music until this kind of thing exists no longer . '
`` I 'm dreadfully bad ; and my husband 's not very good , '' sighed Clarissa .
The woman asked me if I thought her husband looked like a gentleman ! ''
`` And these people do n't see it ! ''
`` Not every one , '' said Rachel , and stopped .
`` I should n't be so sure of that , '' said Clarissa .
`` Observe my Panama , '' he said , touching the brim of his hat .
Therefore I am going to sit down .
Every other woman does ; on that account , I do n't read 'em . ''
I answer -- Yes and No .
`` If the widow goes to her cupboard and finds it bare , '' Richard answered , `` her spiritual outlook we may admit will be affected .
I can conceive no more exalted aim -- to be the citizen of the Empire .
You have very great virtues ; I am the first , I hope , to admit that ; but I have never met a woman who even saw what is meant by statesmanship .
I am going to make you still more angry .
She was trying to apologise for white underclothes fallen and scattered on the floor .
He stood beside his wife .
`` There are three stages of convalescence , I always say , '' broke in the hearty voice of Willoughby .
Why should it ? ''
Have you ever read Burke ? ''
Helen advised bed , and she went , not seeing Richard again .
The wall behind him oozed with damp , which collected into drops and slid down .
`` D'you suppose we shall ever meet in London ? ''
`` Well , good-bye .
I _do_ like you , '' she murmured as she kissed Rachel .
The boat separating from the vessel made off towards the land , and for some minutes Helen , Ridley , and Rachel leant over the rail , watching .
`` Come and talk to me instead of practising , '' and led the way to the sheltered side where the deck-chairs were stretched in the sun .
Rachel followed her indifferently .
Her mind was absorbed by Richard ; by the extreme strangeness of what had happened , and by a thousand feelings of which she had not been conscious before .
While Mrs. Ambrose arranged her embroidery , sucked her silk , and threaded her needle , she lay back gazing at the horizon .
I never liked my Aunts . ''
`` It 's an odd fate that has put me in charge of a girl , '' she wrote , `` considering that I have never got on well with women , or had much to do with them .
The question is , how should one educate them .
The present method seems to me abominable .
Her ignorance upon other matters as important '' ( here Mrs. Ambrose 's letter may not be quoted ) .
It seems to me not merely foolish but criminal to bring people up like that .
Keeping them ignorant , of course , defeats its own object , and when they begin to understand they take it all much too seriously .
Unluckily such men seem almost as rare as the women .
Moreover , the house began to stir as the hour of dinner approached ; she could hear the plates being chinked in the dining-room next door , and Chailey instructing the Spanish girl where to put things down in vigorous English .
`` We shall never understand ! ''
Here was the gentleman who , a few hours previously , in the shade of the curtain , had seemed to consist entirely of legs .
Deep in an arm-chair he was reading the third volume of Gibbon 's _History_ _of_ _the_ _Decline_ _and_ _Fall_ _of_ _Rome_ by candle-light .
It seemed likely that this process might continue for an hour or more , until the entire regiment had shifted its quarters , had not the door opened , and the young man , who was inclined to be stout , come in with large naked feet .
`` I got out of bed , '' said Hewet vaguely , `` merely to talk I suppose . ''
`` I 'm afraid you ca n't be very happy here then , Miss Allan , '' said Susan .
`` Now that we old people are alone , -- we 're on our second honeymoon , -- I am really going to put myself to school again .
After all we are _founded_ on the past , are n't we , Mr. Hewet ?
One ought to know so much more than one does .
Owing to the heat of the day , luncheon was generally a silent meal , when people observed their neighbors and took stock of any new faces there might be , hazarding guesses as to who they were and what they did .
She was seated at a small table with Susan .
Shall I say yes , then ?
`` Cows , '' he reflected , `` draw together in a field ; ships in a calm ; and we 're just the same when we 've nothing else to do .
`` I do n't see any need to get off , '' said Miss Allan to Mrs. Elliot just behind her , `` considering the difficulty I had getting on . ''
`` I do n't call this _life_ , do you ? ''
He looked at her sharply .
Amiable and modest , respectable in many ways , lovable even in their contentment and desire to be kind , how mediocre they all were , and capable of what insipid cruelty to one another !
There was Mrs. Thornbury , sweet but trivial in her maternal egoism ; Mrs. Elliot , perpetually complaining of her lot ; her husband a mere pea in a pod ; and Susan -- she had no self , and counted neither one way nor the other ; Venning was as honest and as brutal as a schoolboy ; poor old Thornbury merely trod his round like a horse in a mill ; and the less one examined into Evelyn 's character the better , he suspected .
Put among them some one more vital , who cared for life or for beauty , and what an agony , what a waste would they inflict on him if he tried to share with them and not to scourge !
One of these parties was dominated by Hughling Elliot and Mrs. Thornbury , who , having both read the same books and considered the same questions , were now anxious to name the places beneath them and to hang upon them stores of information about navies and armies , political parties , natives and mineral products -- all of which combined , they said , to prove that South America was the country of the future .
`` Look here , '' said Mr. Perrott , `` you do n't give me a chance .
But I do n't see precisely -- conquer a territory ?
`` D'you mind if we sit down here ? ''
`` It's jolly in the shade -- and the view -- '' They sat down , and looked straight ahead of them in silence for some time .
They would live in London , perhaps have a cottage in the country near Susan 's family , for they would find it strange without her at first .
They lay in each other 's arms and had no notion that they were observed .
Yet two figures suddenly appeared among the trees above them .
`` Here's shade , '' began Hewet , when Rachel suddenly stopped dead .
They saw a man and woman lying on the ground beneath them , rolling slightly this way and that as the embrace tightened and slackened .
Nor could you tell from her expression whether she was happy , or had suffered something .
Hewet felt uncomfortably shy .
`` Rachel , '' he repeated .
Have you any aunts ? ''
`` You look very comfortable ! ''
It appeared that , coming to the same spot a few minutes after Hewet and Rachel , Helen and Hirst had seen precisely the same thing .
`` One of the three , or is it five , most distinguished men in England , '' Hewet remarked .
`` It 's like having a puppy in the house having you with one -- a puppy that brings one 's underclothes down into the hall . ''
`` To be dead ? ''
Pepper stopped and began a discourse upon round dances , country dances , morris dances , and quadrilles , all of which are entirely superior to the bastard waltz and spurious polka which have ousted them most unjustly in contemporary popularity -- when the waiters gently pushed him on to his table in the corner .
`` This _is_ nice , '' said Hewet .
`` This is n't half a bad floor , '' Rachel said .
`` Mon Dieu ! ''
he exclaimed , throwing out his hands .
`` You must begin to-morrow .
What I want to know is -- '' he looked at her critically .
You love it too , Miss Vinrace ? ''
she asked , as they stopped for a second .
`` That 's typical of Rachel , '' she said .
`` She changes her view of life about every other day .
She 's been brought up practically in a nunnery .
Her father 's too absurd .
`` I was afraid it was my husband , still reading Greek , '' she said .
`` All this time he 's been editing _Pindar_ . ''
`` I see through everything -- absolutely everything .
Life has no more mysteries for me . ''
Then Helen rose and bade them good-night .
`` However , they did -- and we selfish old creatures go on . ''
`` I ca n't think how people come to imagine such things , '' she would say , taking off her spectacles and looking up with the old faded eyes , that were becoming ringed with white .
Her voice , though low , was full of surprise .
Hewet drew still farther back .
His heart was beating very quickly .
Apparently Rachel tried to pull Helen out on to the terrace , and helen resisted .
Then a man 's form appeared .
Hewet could not hear what they were all saying .
`` Are you really sympathetic , or is it just a pose ? ''
Hewet could see that there was very little use in going on with the conversation , for it was obvious that Evelyn did not wish to say anything in particular , but to impress upon him an image of herself , being , for some reason which she would not reveal , unhappy , or insecure .
he muttered to himself as he went upstairs .
Why was it that relations between different people were so unsatisfactory , so fragmentary , so hazardous , and words so dangerous that the instinct to sympathise with another human being was an instinct to be examined carefully and probably crushed ?
What had Evelyn really wished to say to him ?
`` There 's not a white hair on your head , '' he exclaimed .
`` His pictures excite me -- nothin ' that 's old excites me . ''
I 'd infinitely rather break stones than clean out poultry runs , or feed the cows , or -- ''
She was instantly ashamed of her figure of speech , for she could not explain it in words of sober criticism .
`` Ugly in body , repulsive in mind , '' she thought , instead of thinking about Gibbon 's style .
Hirst enquired , raising his eyebrows .
As Helen returned to the garden again , Ridley 's words of warning came into her head , and she hesitated a moment and looked at Rachel sitting between Hirst and Hewet .
`` Is any one here inclined for a walk ? ''
`` There 's a magnificent walk , up behind the house .
The rocks are all red ; you can see them through the water .
The other day I saw a sight that fairly took my breath away -- about twenty jelly-fish , semi-transparent , pink , with long streamers , floating on the top of the waves . ''
Somewhere in the depths of her , too , she was bound to Rachel by the indestructible if inexplicable ties of sex .
They gave him , certainly , what no woman could give him , not Helen even .
Warming at the thought of them , he went on to lay his case before Mrs. Ambrose .
`` Oh yes , '' he said .
`` Good Lord ! ''
`` Aunt Clara carves the neck of lamb , '' Rachel continued .
We talk -- oh yes , it 's Aunt Lucy 's afternoon at Walworth , so we 're rather quick over luncheon .
She has a purple bag , and a black notebook .
It 's the 18th of April -- the same day as it is here .
The ground is rather damp .
There 's generally a haze over the low parts of London ; but it 's often blue over the park when London 's in a mist .
Well , then , it smells very good , particularly if they happen to be burning wood in the keeper 's lodge which is there .
She reviewed their little journeys to and fro , to Walworth , to charwomen with bad legs , to meetings for this and that , their minute acts of charity and unselfishness which flowered punctually from a definite view of what they ought to do , their friendships , their tastes and habits ; she saw all these things like grains of sand falling , falling through innumerable days , making an atmosphere and building up a solid mass , a background .
He has a coat ; it was once a very good coat .
Fashionable life , too , I have to represent at some length , in order to show my hero under all circumstances .
Disowned by her father , she marries my hero , and they live in a snug little villa outside Croydon , in which town he is set up as a house agent .
he enquired ; `` or perhaps you 'd like my Stuart tragedy better , '' he continued , without waiting for her to answer him .
People clap spurs to their horses , and so on .
Terence asked , as they got up and turned inland again .
Instead of sharing their views upon all subjects , and plunging after an idea wherever it might lead , they spoke chiefly in comment upon the people they saw , and the secret between them made itself felt in what they said even of Thornburys and Elliots .
She was not severe upon individuals so much as incredulous of the kindness of destiny , fate , what happens in the long run , and apt to insist that this was generally adverse to people in proportion as they deserved well .
With a certain pleasure she developed these views to her niece , taking a letter from home as her test : which gave good news , but might just as well have given bad .
`` It 's happening to somebody : why should n't it happen to me ? ''
she would argue , her face taking on the stoical expression of anticipated sorrow .
If Rachel was ignorant of her own feelings , she was even more completely ignorant of his .
At first he moved as a god ; as she came to know him better he was still the centre of light , but combined with this beauty a wonderful power of making her daring and confident of herself .
When she thought of their relationship she saw rather than reasoned , representing her view of what Terence felt by a picture of him drawn across the room to stand by her side .
This passage across the room amounted to a physical sensation , but what it meant she did not know .
`` Well , what did you think of it ? ''
They were all marked by something of the jerk and decision of their maker ; they were all perfectly untrained onslaughts of the brush upon some half-realised idea suggested by hill or tree ; and they were all in some way characteristic of Mrs. Flushing .
And we shall sell 'em to smart women in London , '' she chuckled , as though the thought of these ladies and their absurd appearance amused her .
Everything he saw was distasteful to him .
She was at this moment talking to him , and it might be true , as he said , that she was in love with him .
`` I 've never met a man that was fit to compare with a woman ! ''
She did not think of Evelyn 's position ; she only thought that the world was full or people in torment .
`` I wish you 'd sit down and talk , '' said Evelyn impatiently .
`` That 's where we got lost the first night , '' she said .
That might be , although every room and passage and chair in the place had a character of its own in Rachel 's eyes ; but she could not bring herself to stay in one place any longer .
She moved slowly towards the door .
Rachel was swinging the bottle by the neck .
When it fell loose her hair only came down to her neck .
`` Shall we descend ? ''
`` You 're only half alive , '' she continued .
They had seen the broad blue mark across the sand where it flowed into the sea , and the green cloud of trees mass themselves about it farther up , and finally hide its waters altogether from sight .
`` Look at Hirst ! ''
What would he do , she wanted to know , if the boat ran upon a rock and sank .
`` You must always remember , Alice , '' he said , `` that your upbringing was very unnatural -- unusual , I should say .
Tell them about the bath , Alice . ''
`` And all this going on in the heart of England , in the nineteenth century ! ''
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Flushing .
He nodded his head at a sailor who leant over the side spitting into the river .
He wished , at any rate , to be near her , but he found that he could say nothing .
They could hear Mr. Flushing flowing on , now about his wife , now about art , now about the future of the country , little meaningless words floating high in air .
`` Is it true , or is it a dream ? ''
Looking on shore as Mr. Flushing bade her , she thought the country very beautiful , but also sultry and alarming .
Whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the cause of it , or something less definite , she could not determine .
Hirst , too , was depressed .
Why did n't they talk ?
He supposed that they were engaged , or about to become engaged , but instead of being in the least romantic or exciting , that was as dull as everything else ; it annoyed him , too , to think that they were in love .
Can you suggest a rhyme ?
She murmured , considered her own life , but could not describe how it looked to her now .
Feeling this painfully , she exclaimed , `` It will be a fight . ''
But as she looked at him she perceived from the shape of his eyes , the lines about his mouth , and other peculiarities that he pleased her , and she added :
`` That 's what we want to know , '' they answered , and she guessed that now they were looking at each other .
Helen reflected , speaking more to herself in a rambling style than as a prophetess delivering a message .
In return for what he could tell her she brought him such curiosity and sensitiveness of perception , that he was led to doubt whether any gift bestowed by much reading and living was quite the equal of that for pleasure and pain .
He looked at her face and wondered how it would look in twenty years ' time , when the eyes had dulled , and the forehead wore those little persistent wrinkles which seem to show that the middle-aged are facing something hard which the young do not see ?
Now I liked the Dalloways , '' she continued , `` and they 're gone .
`` There's something I ca n't get hold of in you .
He came up to where she stood looking at him in silence .
But no brush was able to efface completely the expression of happiness , so that Mrs. Ambrose could not treat them when they came downstairs as if they had spent the morning in a way that could be discussed naturally .
It was very hot , and they were indifferent to any amount of silence , so that they lay back in their chairs waiting for something to happen .
The bell rang for luncheon , but there was no sound of movement in the house .
Was there any news ?
St. John shook his head .
She was called Susan Jane , and she came into the kitchen one afternoon , and said that she wanted cook to keep her money for her ; she had twenty pounds in gold .
Then she went out to buy herself a hat .
She came in at half-past five and said that she had taken poison .
Rachel could now afford to laugh at him .
When St. John had disposed of her argument and had satisfied his hunger , he proceeded to tell them that the hotel was seething with scandals , some of the most appalling kind , which had happened in their absence ; he was indeed much given to the study of his kind .
`` Evelyn M. , for example -- but that was told me in confidence . ''
I propose that we should all sign a Round Robin , go to Rodriguez in a body , and insist upon a full enquiry .
`` It 's monstrous .
It was the English , of course ; there must be something wrong in the English blood .
`` You 've all been sitting here , '' she said , `` for almost an hour , and you have n't noticed my figs , or my flowers , or the way the light comes through , or anything .
Rachel could not tell , and she felt for the moment very uncomfortable between Helen and Terence .
She looked from Rachel to Terence .
It was brains that were needed .
If only people with brains -- of course they would want a room , a nice room , in Bloomsbury preferably , where they could meet once a week .
But her head ached ; it ached whichever way she turned it .
`` Look here , Hirst , '' said Terence , `` there 's nothing to be done for two hours . ''
Chailey sits with Rachel while Helen has her luncheon . ''
Terence suffered a terrific shock , like that which he had suffered when Rachel said , `` My head aches . ''
He stilled it by reflecting that Helen was overwrought , and he was upheld in this opinion by his obstinate sense that she was opposed to him in the argument .
He took out a packet of old letters and began turning them over as if in search of one that would confute Terence 's suspicions .
As he searched , he began to tell a story about an English lord who had trusted him -- a great English lord , whose name he had , unfortunately , forgotten .
He went up , knocked at Rachel 's door , and asked Helen whether he might see her for a few minutes .
`` There it falls ! ''
As he passed Helen she asked him in the same weary , unnatural , but determined voice to fetch her more ice , and to have the jug outside filled with fresh milk .
`` Do n't be a damned fool ! ''
The light of his candle flickered over the boughs of a tree outside the window , and as the branch swayed in the darkness there came before his mind a picture of all the world that lay outside his window ; he thought of the immense river and the immense forest , the vast stretches of dry earth and the plains of the sea that encircled the earth ; from the sea the sky rose steep and enormous , and the air washed profoundly between the sky and the sea .
And in those towns were little men and women , tiny men and women .
Nothing mattered , he repeated ; they had no power , no hope .
Nevertheless , although he was convinced that it was absurd and laughable , and that they were small and hopeless , he never lost the sense that these thoughts somehow formed part of a life which he and Rachel would live together .
`` She talked to me , '' she said voluntarily .
`` She asked me what day of the week it was , like herself . ''
Downstairs they could hear the thud of his feet on the floor , as he struggled to break free ; and twice they heard him shout , `` Rachel , Rachel ! ''
`` It seems hard -- very hard , '' she said .
`` I think I want more .
I do n't know exactly what I feel . ''
