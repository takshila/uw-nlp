He used this pen , '' and she lifted a quill pen and laid it down again .
We 're a respectable middle-class family , living at Highgate . ''
Yes , Katharine Hilbery 'll do ... .
He increased her height , he darkened her hair ; but physically there was not much to change in her .
These delicious details , however , were to be worked out in all their ramifications at his leisure ; the main point was that Katharine Hilbery would do ; she would do for weeks , perhaps for months .
In taking her he had provided himself with something the lack of which had left a bare place in his mind for a considerable time .
As he did so , the dining-room door sprang open , a voice exclaimed `` Ralph ! ''
His tone had taken on that shade of pugnacity which suggested to his sister that some personal grievance drove him to take the line he did .
`` Fond as I am of him , he does n't seem to me exactly brilliant ... .
`` Shall you talk to mother ? ''
Charles must write to Uncle John if he 's going there . ''
Ralph looked at the ceiling , and shut his lips closely together .
`` I do n't often have the time .
But , on the whole , in these first years of the twentieth century , the Alardyces and their relations were keeping their heads well above water .
Now the source of this nobility was , of course , the poet , and his immediate descendants , therefore , were invested with greater luster than the collateral branches .
Mrs. Hilbery , in virtue of her position as the only child of the poet , was spiritually the head of the family , and Katharine , her daughter , had some superior rank among all the cousins and connections , the more so because she was an only child .
It was a duty that they owed the world , and to Katharine , at least , it meant more than that , for if they could not between them get this one book accomplished they had no right to their privileged position .
`` William Rodney , upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor .
`` You always say that , '' she said .
`` I assure you it 's a common 'combination , ' as you call it , in the houses of the clergy .
Katharine Hilbery is coming , by the way , so William Rodney told me . ''
`` I did n't mean to abuse her .
`` No , I sha n't !
`` That was a very interesting paper , '' Mary began , without any shyness , seating herself on the floor opposite to Rodney and Katharine .
`` Certainly I should .
Not that I have any reason at this moment , '' he added hastily , `` to complain of them .
It 's a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason .
Miss Datchet , I dare say , is one of the exceptions .
Do you like Miss Datchet ? ''
`` Oh dear me , no .
`` A solicitor , yes . ''
`` And there 's music and pictures , let alone the society of the people one likes . ''
His library was constantly being diminished .
Such was the scheme as a whole ; and in contemplation of it she would become quite flushed and excited , and have to remind herself of all the details that intervened between her and success .
Katharine mounted past innumerable glass doors , with initials on them , and became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom of her venture .
At the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect herself .
She heard the typewriter and formal professional voices inside , not belonging , she thought , to any one she had ever spoken to .
Her face had to change its expression entirely when she saw Katharine .
Mr. Clacton hastily reverted to the joke about luncheon , and explained how Mrs. Seal fed on a bag of biscuits under the trees , whatever the weather might be , rather , Katharine thought , as though Mrs. Seal were a pet dog who had convenient tricks .
`` But surely , if you care about the welfare of your sex at all , you must wish them to have the vote ? ''
At these remarks Mrs. Seal began to exhibit signs of discomposure , which displayed themselves by a tossing movement of her head , and , as Ralph took a letter from his pocket , and placed his finger upon a certain sentence , she forestalled him by exclaiming in confusion :
`` The standard of morality seems to me frightfully low , '' she observed reflectively , pouring out a second cup of tea , `` especially among women who are n't well educated .
`` It makes me very angry when people tell me lies -- does n't it make you angry ? ''
At them , presumably .
But silence depressed Mrs. Hilbery , and far from minding the presence of maids , she would often address herself to them , and was never altogether unconscious of their approval or disapproval of her remarks .
`` Only one of my geese , happily , makes epigrams -- Augustus Pelham , of course , '' said Mrs. Hilbery .
Any one connected with himself -- ''
Katharine asked , with some diffidence .
her father demanded with sudden irritation .
Did your grandfather ever visit the Hebrides , Katharine ? ''
She looked in a strangely beseeching way at her daughter .
Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on , you know . ''
Katharine read what her mother had written .
How impotent they were , fiddling about all day long with papers !
Mrs. Hilbery had emptied a portfolio containing old photographs over her table , and was looking from one to another .
she concluded , striking her fist against the table .
As often as not , my father was n't in bed three nights out of the seven , but always fresh as paint in the morning .
I hear him now , come singing up the stairs to the nursery , and tossing the loaf for breakfast on his sword-stick , and then off we went for a day's pleasuring -- Richmond , Hampton Court , the Surrey Hills .
Why should n't we go , Katharine ?
It 's going to be a fine day . ''
`` Cyril married ! ''
`` And never telling us a word , though we 've had him in our house since he was a child -- noble William's son !
And yet nobody could have worked harder or done better in all the recognized stages of a young man 's life than Ralph had done , and Joan had to gather materials for her fears from trifles in her brother's behavior which would have escaped any other eye .
I had a basket , '' she explained , `` and I 've left it somewhere .
By this time he had shaped so many sentences and rejected them , felt so many impulses and subdued them , that he was a uniform scarlet .
`` Well , then , why do n't you read me something before I go ? ''
`` Katharine , you 've only just come !
Katharine 's ignorance of Shakespeare did not prevent her from feeling fairly certain that plays should not produce a sense of chill stupor in the audience , such as overcame her as the lines flowed on , sometimes long and sometimes short , but always delivered with the same lilt of voice , which seemed to nail each line firmly on to the same spot in the hearer 's brain .
Still , she reflected , these sorts of skill are almost exclusively masculine ; women neither practice them nor know how to value them ; and one 's husband's proficiency in this direction might legitimately increase one 's respect for him , since mystification is no bad basis for respect .
The reading ended with the finish of the Act ; Katharine had prepared a little speech .
She does command , she is n't nervous ; it comes naturally to her to rule and control .
Perhaps she was bored by drinking tea and reading a book all alone ; at any rate , she tossed the book on to a sofa with a gesture of relief .
Katharine came into the room a moment later .
`` No , '' Mrs. Cosham confirmed her , `` it is not England .
In those days we thought an Indian Judgeship about equal to a county-court judgeship at home .
His Honor -- a pretty title , but still , not at the top of the tree .
`` My father will be back , '' she said .
Their marriage seemed of no importance to him .
He did not blame her ; he blamed nothing , nobody ; he saw the truth .
When he came back to his work after lunch he carried in his head a picture of the Strand , scattered with omnibuses , and of the purple shapes of leaves pressed flat upon the gravel , as if his eyes had always been bent upon the ground .
His brain worked incessantly , but his thought was attended with so little joy that he did not willingly recall it ; but drove ahead , now in this direction , now in that ; and came home laden with dark books borrowed from a library .
`` The sparrows in Hyde Park are n't as tame as this .
`` That 's just when I do n't like them , '' he replied .
`` Still , I do n't see why you should n't cherish that illusion , if it pleases you . ''
`` Wake up , Ralph !
`` What have you been doing with yourself ?
But you can tell me later , '' she said , rather hastily , and then started off in the direction of Russell Square .
She had invited him on the impulse of the moment , as a vision of the country came before her ; and now she was annoyed with herself for having done so , and then she was annoyed at being annoyed .
Was he concealing something from her ?
A magnificent fellow , '' Mrs. Seal agreed .
`` A kind of St. Bernard , she tells me -- so like Kit to have a St. Bernard .
And you guard your mistress well , do n't you , Sailor ?
That 's what I feel , you know , about these meetings .
Each one of them is a step onwards in the great march -- humanity , you know .
Her eye brightened ; she felt immediately convinced that Ralph had come to visit her .
Meanwhile , they had come to the end of the path , and while Elizabeth straightened some flowers , and made them stand upright within their fence of string , Mary looked at her father , who was pacing up and down , with his hand behind his back and his head bowed in meditation .
`` A flower for your buttonhole , father , '' she said , presenting a rose .
I know him better than any one , almost .
But why I 'm marrying him is , partly , I admit -- I 'm being quite honest with you , and you must n't tell any one -- partly because I want to get married .
It is n't possible at home .
It 's all very well for you , Henry ; you can go your own way .
I have to be there always .
Here , presumably , she imagined that her cousin , who had listened with his usual intelligent sympathy , raised his eyebrows a little , and interposed :
`` How I wish -- '' Katharine began , and stopped short .
`` I think these parties are a great mistake , '' she added briefly , and sighed .
`` Oh , horrible ! ''
he agreed ; and they both fell silent .
`` Promise me , Katharine , that if I can ever help you , you will let me . ''
I want to come with you . ''
The penciling of this note gave Rodney time to recover himself .
Perhaps , for he was a very vain man , he was more hurt that Henry had seen him rebuffed than by the rebuff itself .
To tell the truth , Henry labored under the same difficulty ; he did not wish to introduce Katharine 's name , and , therefore , he replied vaguely that he had always heard that Rodney was a great rider .
`` Katharine has n't found herself yet .
This grievance dated back to the middle years of the last century , when , owing to some official intrigue , his merits had been passed over in a disgraceful manner in favor of another , his junior .
And now , my dear Katharine , tell me about your plans . ''
You and Katharine were having a little chat ? ''
How could she go on with what she was saying in Maggie 's presence ?
`` I was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage , '' she said , with a little laugh .
`` Are none of my children looking after you , Maggie ? ''
And you don't get the prizes unless you go to school .
She half laughed , muttered something , and ended on a sigh .
He had not recovered in the least from that depression .
He persuaded himself that he could make an honest statement without speaking her name ; he persuaded himself that his feeling had very little to do with her .
He resented this divided attention more than , perhaps , he knew , and he thought how Mary would soon be on her way to America .
`` I 'm much more selfish than I let on , and I 'm worldly a little -- more than you think , anyhow .
`` Katharine Hilbery ! ''
Mary thought , in an instant of blinding revelation ; `` I 've always known it was Katharine Hilbery ! ''
She knew it all now .
Thus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real body of the woman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams , Ralph stammered ; he made a clutch at his self-control ; the color either came to his cheeks or left them , he knew not which ; but he was determined to face her and track down in the cold light of day whatever vestige of truth there might be in his persistent imaginations .
The wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her face ; the wind had already loosened her hair , which looped across the corner of one of the large , dark eyes which , so he used to think , looked sad ; now they looked bright with the brightness of the sea struck by an unclouded ray ; everything about her seemed rapid , fragmentary , and full of a kind of racing speed .
He realized suddenly that he had never seen her in the daylight before .
`` I want to see you .
Are you going back to London at once ?
I will write . ''
In summer it was a pleasant place , for the deep woods on either side murmured , and the heather , which grew thick round the granite pedestal , made the light breeze taste sweetly ; in winter the sighing of the trees was deepened to a hollow sound , and the heath was as gray and almost as solitary as the empty sweep of the clouds above it .
`` What do I feel about Katharine ? ''
It was clear that she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure , the mistress of her little section of the world ; but more than that , she was the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life , the woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady , as his had never been in spite of all his culture .
He glanced at her , in case her expression might help him to understand her behavior .
I assure you , Katharine , I 've been through it all myself .
What you want , if I may say so , is some occupation to take you out of yourself when this morbid mood comes on .
I believe you are the only person in the world I could live with happily .
And if you feel the same about me -- as you do , do n't you , Mary ?
Here he paused , and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer ; he seemed , indeed , to be continuing his own thoughts .
One more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night , when Elizabeth had gone to her room , and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a day 's shooting .
He wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon-colored leaflet .
`` One would have thought , '' she said , `` that men of University training , like Mr. Asquith -- one would have thought that an appeal to reason would not be unheard by them .
`` I did n't know you had to work after you had left the office , '' said Katharine , in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of something else , as was , indeed , the case .
`` I do n't think you 've got any reason to envy me , '' she said .
Mary could not help feeling the simplicity and good faith that lay behind Katharine 's words .
Mary bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with a poker .
She knew , from the tone of her voice , that in speaking of Ralph she had no desire to probe Mary 's secrets , or to insinuate any of her own .
What prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning ?
The reason was that Katharine might , at any moment , enter the room .
It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see , and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize .
`` It 'll mean , too , I 'm afraid , that I sha n't be as free for a considerable time as I have been , '' he continued .
`` Perhaps , '' said Katharine indifferently .
Katharine , taking her chair beside him , noted his silence and looked at him with sudden apprehension .
What she hoped or feared , she could not have said ; a most irrational and indefensible desire for some assurance of his affection was , perhaps , uppermost in her mind .
Peevishness , complaints , exacting cross-examination she was used to , but this attitude of composed quiet , which seemed to come from the consciousness of power within , puzzled her .
For some reason , too , she felt more at ease with him than usual ; or her ease was more the ease of equality -- she could not stop to think of that at the moment though .
After a moment 's silence William jerked out :
The presence of wise literary speculation , as she calculated , restored William 's confidence in his security , and he replaced the book in the bookcase , keeping his back turned to her as he did so , and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together .
He felt , that is to say , what he had never consciously felt before ; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wont to think him ; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous possibilities .
He very nearly exclaimed aloud :
`` My dear , I feel a thousand things every second .
I do n't know , I 'm sure , what I feel .
Shall we walk on a little ? ''
`` But I do n't know you or your circumstances , '' she said at last , as he remained silent .
`` Ah -- I half wish I 'd called you Mary , but it would n't have gone with Hilbery , and it would n't have gone with Rodney .
Now this is n't the passage I wanted .
( I never can find what I want . )
Her mind , passing from Mary to Denham , from William to Cassandra , and from Denham to herself -- if , as she rather doubted , Denham 's state of mind was connected with herself -- seemed to be tracing out the lines of some symmetrical pattern , some arrangement of life , which invested , if not herself , at least the others , not only with interest , but with a kind of tragic beauty .
No course of action seemed to her indubitably right .
So she could best serve the people who loved .
On getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind to ignore what had been said the night before ; he had been convinced , by the sight of Denham , that his love for Katharine was passionate , and when he addressed her early that morning on the telephone , he had meant his cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to her the fact that , after a night of madness , they were as indissolubly engaged as ever .
She had read his play , and had taken the very first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of it .
The word was underlined .
He could not resist beginning an answer to her there and then .
Katharine never trod that particular measure , he could not help reflecting ; Katharine -- Cassandra ; Cassandra -- Katharine -- they alternated in his consciousness all day long .
What did she mean by her behavior ?
This secrecy is detestable -- it 's dishonorable . ''
Even the road to the Orchid House had now split itself into three .
They retraced their steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think about something that is lost .
What did it contain ?
He had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence in the letter which he had never sent , and now all the force of his character must make good those vows in her presence .
`` Because , '' Denham instantly intervened , `` they do n't make themselves understood at the beginning .
was one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with herself of late .
`` My dear , '' Cassandra exclaimed , shaking the book at her cousin , `` my whole life 's changed from this moment !
`` Afraid , '' said Mr. Basnett , conveying the impression that , in his opinion , no sensible person could be afraid of liking to work .
`` Yes , '' said Katharine , as if he had stated this opinion aloud .
`` In starting a society such as we wish to start ( we ca n't say any more at present ) , '' Mr. Basnett began , with a little jerk of his head , `` there are two things to remember -- the Press and the public .
It was clear that he was irritated , and Cassandra felt for his annoyance .
They were standing by the pen of some Oriental hog , and she was prodding the brute gently with the point of her umbrella , when a thousand little observations seemed , in some way , to collect in one center .
Nevertheless , her manner became immediately different , as if , for the first time , she felt consciously womanly , and as if William might conceivably wish later on to confide in her .
`` Cassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland Place , '' he replied .
`` Wo n't you come up to my room ? ''
It 's difficult to see that there may be sense in what one 's opponents say , though they are one 's opponents .
Horace Basnett is certainly too uncompromising .
I must n't forget to see that he writes that letter to Judson .
You 're too busy , I suppose , to come on to our committee ? ''
she said at length , and shook her pillow , as if making ready for sleep .
`` Heaven knows , '' Katharine replied .
`` I sha n't let her stay in the kitchen , though .
I shall bring her up here . ''
`` But we might meet your mother upon the stairs .
`` Do you mean , '' said Katharine , `` that he has fallen in love with her ? ''
William came back to Katharine ; he found her standing where he had left her .
Could Cassandra love him ?
He tried to compose himself .
At length William broke the silence .
`` You would have waited all night if it had n't been for William .
What could you see ?
Nothing but our windows . ''
`` Well , it 's bad enough .
But my state is worse than yours , because it has n't anything to do with facts .
It 's an hallucination , pure and simple -- an intoxication ... .
Ralph found that she had turned upon him a gaze that was at once very vague and very penetrating .
`` But I 'm sure you read poetry at night .
I always judge by the expression of the eyes , '' Mrs. Hilbery continued .
`` I do n't know much about the law , '' she went on , `` though many of my relations were lawyers .
`` The night and the stars , the dawn coming up , the barges swimming past , the sun setting ... .
I sometimes think that poetry is n't so much what we write as what we feel , Mr .
It seemed to her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap of dust .
`` Oh , a fraud like the rest of them -- at least Henry says so , '' Cassandra replied .
`` Though I do n't believe everything Henry says , '' she added a little defensively .
`` But she ca n't -- '' William exclaimed , as the door shut , `` not without any gloves and bread and butter in her hand ! ''
`` What would be the time now ? ''
said Katharine at last .
`` But why should it matter ?
The door shut between them , and Mary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone .
`` Oh , I know nothing about that .
Then , to puzzle her further , William and Ralph filled in all interstices of meal-times or railway journeys with perfectly good-tempered arguments ; or they discussed politics , or they told stories , or they did sums together upon the backs of old envelopes to prove something .
She suspected that Katharine was absent-minded , but it was impossible to tell .
`` Who has Cassandra gone out with ?
`` Oh , some time ago -- a week , perhaps more . ''
`` Oh , yes . ''
`` Names are n't everything ; it 's what we feel that 's everything .
I did n't want silly , kind , interfering letters .
I prayed that it might be so . ''
She looked at her daughter .
Katharine faltered beneath that innocent and penetrating gaze ; she flushed , turned away , and then looked up with very bright eyes .
`` But , Katharine , you ARE in love ! ''
at which Katharine flushed , looked startled , as if she had said something that she ought not to have said , and shook her head .
`` It 's the Church of England service you both object to ? ''
`` I do n't care a damn what service it is , '' Ralph replied .
Ralph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say .
I ... '' He was turning tail , but the door opening and the familiar look of the house asserting its charm , he bolted in on the wake of the others , and the door shut upon his escape .
The fire burnt as usual , the little tables were laid with china and silver .
There was nobody there .
The moment of exposure had been exquisitely painful -- the light shed startlingly vivid .
She had now to get used to the fact that some one shared her loneliness .
She hardly dared steep herself in the infinite bliss .
`` Why do n't you tell us you 're glad ? ''
She seemed to behold her with that curious intensity which she had lost ; as a being who walks just beyond our sphere , so that life in their presence is a heightened process , illuminating not only ourselves but a considerable stretch of the surrounding world .
`` Well , that 's my last attempt at the dramatic . ''
He poured out wine ; he bade Denham help himself .
She thought , looking at the sky above Chancery Lane , how the roof was the same everywhere ; how she was now secure of all that this lofty blue and its steadfast lights meant to her ; reality , was it , figures , love , truth ?
No , I ca n't tell you . ''
`` Answering them , '' she replied .
`` You are going to have a baby ? ''
Here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their reports .
`` Damn the woman ! ''
Here was Three Bridges station .
Was he going to leave us ?
Are you the man who 's walled up in green cardboard boxes , and sometimes has the blinds down , and sometimes sits so solemn staring like a sphinx , and always there 's a look of the sepulchral , something of the undertaker , the coffin , and the dusk about horse and driver ?
Do tell me -- but the doors slammed .
We shall never meet again .
James Moggridge is dead now , gone for ever .
Well , Minnie -- '' I can face it no longer . ''
If she said that -- ( Let me look at her .
-- the entombed soul , the spirit driven in , in , in to the central catacomb ; the self that took the veil and left the world -- a coward perhaps , yet somehow beautiful , as it flits with its lantern restlessly up and down the dark corridors .
`` Not for me -- not for me . ''
`` I 'll wait by my bag , ma'am , that 's safest .
Was it the sound of the second violin tuning in the ante-room ?
Here they come ; four black figures , carrying instruments , and seat themselves facing the white squares under the downpour of light ; rest the tips of their bows on the music stand ; with a simultaneous movement lift them ; lightly poise them , and , looking across at the player opposite , the first violin counts one , two , three -- --
Fountains jet ; drops descend .
How the dragonfly kept circling round us : how clearly I see the dragonfly and her shoe with the square silver buckle at the toe .
I might get up , but if I got up and looked at it , ten to one I should n't be able to say for certain ; because once a thing 's done , no one ever knows how it happened .
dear me , the mystery of life ; The inaccuracy of thought !
To show how very little control of our possessions we have -- what an accidental affair this living is after all our civilization -- let me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime , beginning , for that seems always the most mysterious of losses -- what cat would gnaw , what rat would nibble -- three pale blue canisters of book-binding tools ?
Then there were the bird cages , the iron hoops , the steel skates , the Queen Anne coal-scuttle , the bagatelle board , the hand organ -- all gone , and jewels , too .
Opals and emeralds , they lie about the roots of turnips .
Why , if one wants to compare life to anything , one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour -- landing at the other end without a single hairpin in one 's hair !
I must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall really is -- a nail , a rose-leaf , a crack in the wood ?
`` Did he take his bottle well ? ''
For the wind was tearing across the coast , hurling itself at the hills , and leaping , in sudden gusts , on top of its own back .
How it spread over the town in the hollow !
How the lights seemed to wink and quiver in its fury , lights in the harbour , lights in bedroom windows high up !
And rolling dark waves before it , it raced over the Atlantic , jerking the stars above the ships this way and that .
No one had ever been cheered by the Aquarium ; but the faces of those emerging quickly lost their dim , chilled expression when they perceived that it was only by standing in a queue that one could be admitted to the pier .
Once through the turnstiles , every one walked for a yard or two very briskly ; some flagged at this stall ; others at that .
But there was a time when none of this had any existence ( thought the young man leaning against the railings ) .
Fix your eyes upon the lady's skirt ; the grey one will do -- above the pink silk stockings .
The heavy chariot may swing along the turnpike road , but there 's no pier for it to stop at , and how grey and turbulent the sea is in the seventeenth century !
Let 's to the museum .
Jaspar Floyd dug them up at his own expense early in the forties in the Roman camp on Dods Hill -- see the little ticket with the faded writing on it .
But the letter which Mr. Floyd found on the table when he got up early next morning did not begin `` I am much surprised , '' and it was such a motherly , respectful , inconsequent , regretful letter that he kept it for many years ; long after his marriage with Miss Wimbush , of Andover ; long after he had left the village .
But Jacob had grown such a fine young man that Mr. Floyd did not like to stop him in the street .
A strong smell of camphor came from the butterfly boxes .
And his mother had taken him for a burglar when he came home late .
The fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows .
The blues settled on little bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them , and the painted ladies and the peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails dropped by a hawk .
And if you looked out at dawn you could always see two badgers .
Sometimes they knocked each other over like two boys fighting , she said .
And again , `` That 'll do , thank you , Mr .
`` Mr. Floyd was at Cambridge ... no , at Oxford ... well , at one or the other , '' said Mrs. Flanders .
`` My people 'll see to that , '' said Durrant ( the son of a banker , deceased ) .
Although young men still went in and out , they walked as if keeping engagements .
Now and then there was a thud , as if some heavy piece of furniture had fallen , unexpectedly , of its own accord , not in the general stir of life after dinner .
But this was a diversion .
But , after all , not so difficult if on the next staircase , in the large room , there are two , three , five young men all convinced of this -- of brutality , that is , and the clear division between right and wrong .
The answer came from the sofa corner ; for his pipe was held in the air , then replaced .
He had something to say to THAT , though the sturdy red-haired boy at the table seemed to deny it , wagging his head slowly from side to side ; and then , taking out his penknife , he dug the point of it again and again into a knot in the table , as if affirming that the voice from the fender spoke the truth -- which Jacob could not deny .
`` D'you know Masham 's aunt ? ''
`` But this woman I was telling you about -- Masham 's aunt -- ''
`` Lord Chancellor before he 's fifty , '' said Timmy .

`` Very lonely it must be in winter , with the wind sweeping over those hills , and the waves dashing on the rocks . ''
Even on a summer 's day you hear them murmuring .
`` It 's so interesting to guess ... '' murmured Julia Eliot .
Mr. Clutterbuck read the Times .
In the distance stood a second lamp , and round it sat the young ladies , flashing scissors over silver-spangled stuff for private theatricals .
Mr. Sopwith 's opinion was as sentimental as Clara 's , though far more skilfully expressed .
Now , I suppose , old Barfoot is talking to my mother .
The problem is insoluble .
`` And which of them ... ? ''
asked Mr. Salvin , dropping his voice and speaking in quizzical tones .
`` Everybody seems to come in here ... .
About half-past nine Jacob left the house , his door slamming , other doors slamming , buying his paper , mounting his omnibus , or , weather permitting , walking his road as other people do .
... Talk about football , the Hotspurs , the Harlequins ; six-thirty Star brought in by the office boy ; the rooks of Gray 's Inn passing overhead ; branches in the fog thin and brittle ; and through the roar of traffic now and again a voice shouting : `` Verdict -- verdict -- winner -- winner , '' while letters accumulate in a basket , Jacob signs them , and each evening finds him , as he takes his coat down , with some muscle of the brain new stretched .
But if the pale blue envelope lying by the biscuit-box had the feelings of a mother , the heart was torn by the little creak , the sudden stir .
My son , my son -- such would be her cry , uttered to hide her vision of him stretched with Florinda , inexcusable , irrational , in a woman with three children living at Scarborough .
Five minutes , ten minutes , fifteen minutes passed .
The Prime Minister proposed a measure for giving Home Rule to Ireland .
Jacob knocked out his pipe .
A very cold night .
`` I used to ride , '' she said .
There were shirtings , murmurings , apologetic sneezes , and sudden unashamed devastating coughs .
Ushers were collecting exercises .
Lazy children wanted to stretch .
Good ones scribbled assiduously -- ah , another day over and so little done !
And now and then was to be heard from the whole collection of human beings a heavy sigh , after which the humiliating old man would cough shamelessly , and Miss Marchmont hinnied like a horse .
Down upon them came the splendid Magdalen , brown , warm , voluminous , scarcely brushing the grass with her sandalled feet .
She sat in a flowered Spanish shawl , holding in her hand a yellow novel .
Then there she was herself , whirling across the stage in white flounces , and the music was the dance and fling of her own soul , and the whole machinery , rock and gear of the world was spun smoothly into those swift eddies and falls , she felt , as she stood rigid leaning over the barrier two feet from Jacob Flanders .
The fresh wind scatters the children 's voices all about .
My children , thought Fanny Elmer .
Gently the baby is rocked in the perambulator .
What can be more violent than the fling of boughs in a gale , the tree yielding itself all up the trunk , to the very tip of the branch , streaming and shuddering the way the wind blows , yet never flying in dishevelment away ?
But coming along Gerrard Street was a tall man in a shabby coat .
She would learn Latin and read Virgil .
Nick perhaps , only he was so stupid .
There they sat quietly of a night reading , she thought .
`` Archer , '' said Mrs. Flanders with that tenderness which mothers so often display towards their eldest sons , `` will be at Gibraltar to-morrow . ''
`` What 's the season of the year ? ''
He looked out of the window .
`` Everybody feeds them , '' said Jinny , waving the pigeons away .
`` They're stupid old things . ''
`` It is perfectly dry , '' said Mrs. Jarvis , as they shut the orchard door and stepped on to the turf .
The clock struck the quarter .
Mrs. Jarvis , who is fifty years of age , reposes in the camp in the hazy moonlight .
`` Caramel custard presumably , '' said her husband in the same cadence , with his toothpick out already .
But for himself , what with his height ( Napoleon was five feet four , he remembered ) , his bulk , his inability to impose his own personality ( and yet great men are needed more than ever now , he sighed ) , it was useless .
He was up very early , looking at the statues with his Baedeker .
Sandra rode opposite , dominant , like a Victory prepared to fling into the air .
he suspected ( and that was not true either ) .
And then looking up and seeing the sharp outline , his meditations were given an extraordinary edge ; Greece was over ; the Parthenon in ruins ; yet there he was .
The orange trees which flourish in the Square of the Constitution , the band , the dragging of feet , the sky , the houses , lemon and rose coloured -- all this became so significant to Mrs. Wentworth Williams after her second cup of coffee that she began dramatizing the story of the noble and impulsive Englishwoman who had offered a seat in her carriage to the old American lady at Mycenae ( Mrs. Duggan ) -- not altogether a false story , though it said nothing of Evan , standing first on one foot , then on the other , waiting for the women to stop chattering .
`` Yes , '' said Jacob .
And they moved off to the window together , while Evan spoke to the head waiter about calling them early .
For she could not stop until she had told him -- or heard him say -- or was it some action on his part that she required ?
`` Write and tell me about it , '' she said .
`` And tell me what you feel and what you think .
At sea the piers stood out , marked by separate dots ; the waves being invisible , and promontories and islands were dark humps with a few lights .
Violent was the wind now rushing down the Sea of Marmara between Greece and the plains of Troy .
Only here -- in Lombard Street and Fetter Lane and Bedford Square -- each insect carries a globe of the world in his head , and the webs of the forest are schemes evolved for the smooth conduct of business ; and honey is treasure of one sort and another ; and the stir in the air is the indescribable agitation of life .
`` Why do n't the young people settle it , eh ? ''
he wanted to ask .
-- a question poor Clara could not have answered , since , as Mrs. Durrant discussed with Sir Edgar the policy of Sir Edward Grey , Clara only wondered why the cabinet looked dusty , and Jacob had never come .
She looked at the clock ; looked at the door ; looked at the long glass opposite ; disposed her cloak ; drew closer to the table , for she was pregnant -- no doubt about it , Mother Stuart said , recommending remedies , consulting friends ; sunk , caught by the heel , as she tripped so lightly over the surface .
Bramham lifted his glass .
`` There you are .
Go and get drunk . ''
Even now poor Fanny Elmer was dealing , as she walked along the Strand , in her incompetent way with this very careless , indifferent , sublime manner he had of talking to railway guards or porters ; or Mrs. Whitehorn , when she consulted him about her little boy who was beaten by the schoolmaster .
Timmy Durrant in his little room in the Admiralty , going to consult a Blue book , stopped for a moment by the window and observed the placard tied round the lamp-post .
Mrs. Durrant , sitting with Mr. Wortley in a motor-car , was impatient lest they should miss the overture .
`` He left a commentary .
`` The Pump in Neville 's Row , for example ? ''
`` It 's odd that every one should be an old friend of Mr. Pepper 's , '' Rachel started nervously , for the situation was difficult , the room cold , and Helen curiously silent .
Mrs. Chailey was expected to sit in a cabin which was large enough , but too near the boilers , so that after five minutes she could hear her heart `` go , '' she complained , putting her hand above it , which was a state of things that Mrs. Vinrace , Rachel 's mother , would never have dreamt of inflicting -- Mrs. Vinrace , who knew every sheet in her house , and expected of every one the best they could do , but no more .
`` It 's books , '' sighed Helen , lifting an armful of sad volumes from the floor to the shelf .
`` Greek from morning to night .
Mrs. Ambrose would have found it very dull .
She was working at a great design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest , where spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit , bananas , oranges , and giant pomegranates , while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air .
Between the stitches she looked to one side and read a sentence about the Reality of Matter , or the Nature of Good .
By these means Rachel reached that stage in thinking , if thinking it can be called , when the eyes are intent upon a ball or a knob and the lips cease to move .
Reality dwelling in what one saw and felt , but did not talk about , one could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people , without often troubling to think about it , except as something superficially strange .
Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion , her mind seemed to enter into communion , to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck , with the spirit of the sea , with the spirit of Beethoven Op .
The rising and falling of the ball of thistledown was represented by the sudden droop forward of her own head , and when it passed out of sight she was asleep .
But Helen came in at that point , and Mrs. Dalloway saw with relief that though slightly eccentric in appearance , she was not untidy , held herself well , and her voice had restraint in it , which she held to be the sign of a lady .
`` I do n't care a fig one way or t'other , '' said Ambrose .
He 'll soon learn better . ''
`` Do n't you ever find it rather dull ? ''
`` If you ask me whether I ever find it rather dull , '' he said , `` I am bound to say yes ; on the other hand , if you ask me what career do you consider on the whole , taking the good with the bad , the most enjoyable and enviable , not to speak of its more serious side , of all careers , for a man , I am bound to say , 'The Politician 's . '
`` It 's dreadful , '' said Mrs. Dalloway , who , while her husband spoke , had been thinking .
Do n't you feel , '' she wound up , addressing Helen , `` that life 's a perpetual conflict ? ''
`` No , '' she said .
`` I do n't think I do . ''
`` We sit in here , '' said Helen , opening the door of the saloon .
`` To be a leader of men , '' Richard soliloquised .
But neither Richard nor Clarissa profited by the verdict , for directly it seemed likely that they would overhear , Richard crackled a sheet of paper .
`` A grand fellow , Shakespeare , '' he said , replacing the volume .
`` You have children -- your husband was in Parliament ? ''
`` I was n't thinking of a man particularly , '' said Clarissa .
`` But you will . ''
`` Are you aware , Miss Vinrace , how much can be done to induce fine weather by appropriate headdress ?
I advise you to follow my example . ''
Three chairs in a row invited them to be seated .
If on the one hand I have not accomplished what I set out to accomplish -- which of us does !
`` Explain , Miss Vinrace , '' said Richard .
Richard bent his head to show that he accepted the widow .
If I may pick holes in your philosophy , Miss Vinrace , which has its merits , I would point out that a human being is not a set of compartments , but an organism .
Now for your second point ; when you assert that in trying to set the house in order for the benefit of the young generation I am wasting my higher capabilities , I totally disagree with you .
Look at it in this way , Miss Vinrace ; conceive the state as a complicated machine ; we citizens are parts of that machine ; some fulfil more important duties ; others ( perhaps I am one of them ) serve only to connect some obscure parts of the mechanism , concealed from the public eye .
I hope that I never shall meet such a woman .
Now , Miss Vinrace , are we enemies for life ? ''
`` I did , '' he smiled .
`` Try a turn with me , '' Ridley called across to Rachel .
`` The milk stage , the bread-and-butter stage , and the roast-beef stage .
I should say you were at the bread-and-butter stage . ''
He handed him the plate .
`` But can you remember if your wife takes sugar ? ''
She must have been very tired for she fell asleep at once , but after an hour or two of dreamless sleep , she dreamt .
At length the tunnel opened and became a vault ; she found herself trapped in it , bricks meeting her wherever she turned , alone with a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering , with long nails .
Still and cold as death she lay , not daring to move , until she broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed , and woke crying `` Oh ! ''
Once Mrs. Dalloway turned and waved ; but the boat steadily grew smaller and smaller until it ceased to rise and fall , and nothing could be seen save two resolute backs .
`` M-m-m'yes , '' she said , after a pause .
`` I thought he was that kind of man . ''
There was little doubt about that according to Helen , but she restrained herself and said aloud :
`` It 's a pity to be intimate with people who are -- well , rather second-rate , like the Dalloways , and to find it out later . ''
`` I really ca n't tell you , '' replied Helen candidly , after a moment's thought .
Willoughby 's selfishness , though consistent as Helen saw with real affection for his daughter , made her determined to have the girl to stay with her , even if she had to promise a complete course of instruction in the feminine graces .
She could not help laughing at the notion of it -- Rachel a Tory hostess !
-- and marvelling as she left him at the astonishing ignorance of a father .
`` Three hundred years odd , '' said Mr. Pepper meditatively at length .
If they were properly educated I do n't see why they should n't be much the same as men -- as satisfactory I mean ; though , of course , very different .
My brother-in-law really deserved a catastrophe -- which he wo n't get .
The English colony certainly does n't provide one ; artists , merchants , cultivated people -- they are stupid , conventional , and flirtatious .
Old Mrs. Paley , having woken hungry but without her spectacles , was summoning her maid to find the biscuit-box .
`` You 're sitting on my pyjamas . ''
I speak as one who plumbs Life 's dim profound , One who at length can sound Clear views and certain .
`` Oh , but I would give so much to realise the ancient world ! ''
My soldier son says that there is still a great deal to be learnt from Hannibal .
Somehow when I read the paper , I begin with the debates first , and , before I 've done , the door always opens -- we 're a very large party at home -- and so one never does think enough about the ancients and all they 've done for us .
But _you_ begin at the beginning , Miss Allan . ''
`` Ten minutes to eleven , '' she observed .
Mrs. Paley , although well over seventy and crippled in the legs , enjoyed her food and the peculiarities of her fellow-beings .
`` A little silver goes a long way in this country , '' she chuckled .
`` We 've been cursing you , '' said Ridley in answer to Mrs. Elliot 's kind enquiries about his wife .
`` You tourists eat up all the eggs , Helen tells me .
That 's an eye-sore too '' -- he nodded his head at the hotel .
`` Disgusting luxury , I call it .
We live with pigs in the drawing-room . ''
The wave included both Hirst and Hewet , and Hewet answered , `` I should like it immensely . ''
said Helen ; `` but Hewet -- who 's he ?
One of the young men Ridley met , I suppose .
It may be dreadfully dull . ''
His invitations had been universally accepted , which was the more encouraging as they had been issued against Hirst 's advice to people who were very dull , not at all suited to each other , and sure not to come .
-- is it to prevent ourselves from seeing to the bottom of things '' ( he stopped by a stream and began stirring it with his walking-stick and clouding the water with mud ) , `` making cities and mountains and whole universes out of nothing , or do we really love each other , or do we , on the other hand , live in a state of perpetual uncertainty , knowing nothing , leaping from moment to moment as from world to world ?
`` You 're quite wrong , '' said St. John .
One after another they rose and stretched themselves , and in a few minutes divided more or less into two separate parties .
They 're all conquered already , are n't they ? ''
said Arthur , looking about him .
Even while they had been saying commonplace things Susan had been conscious of the excitement of intimacy , which seemed not only to lay bare something in her , but in the trees and the sky , and the progress of his speech which seemed inevitable was positively painful to her , for no human being had ever come so close to her before .
From this they went on to compare their more serious tastes , or rather Susan ascertained what Arthur cared about , and professed herself very fond of the same thing .
Her mind , stunned to begin with , now flew to the various changes that her engagement would make -- how delightful it would be to join the ranks of the married women -- no longer to hang on to groups of girls much younger than herself -- to escape the long solitude of an old maid 's life .
When Arthur again turned to her , butting her as a lamb butts a ewe , Hewet and Rachel retreated without a word .
`` We were very much moved , '' said Hewet .
`` Thank God , '' Hewet exclaimed .
`` I need no longer feel as though I'd murdered a child ! ''
`` You came out together ? ''
`` Oh , Rachel , '' she cried .
`` More cake for us ! ''
`` But where is Mr .
He sat quite silent , staring at the dancers .
After three minutes the silence became so intolerable to Rachel that she was goaded to advance another commonplace about the beauty of the night .
Hirst interrupted her ruthlessly .
`` One of the three , '' he corrected .
`` You see , the problem is , can one really talk to you ?
When they came to the windows of the ballroom , the swing of the dancers and the lilt of the music was irresistible .
`` This is a very familiar position for me ! ''
she asked , looking at Rachel with maternal eyes .
`` I know I did when I was your age .
How I used to beg my mother to let me stay -- and now I sympathise with the poor mothers -- but I sympathise with the daughters too ! ''
The next dance was beginning ; it was the Barcarolle out of Hoffman , which made Helen beat her toe in time to it ; but she felt that after such a compliment it was impossible to get up and go , and , besides being amused , she was really flattered , and the honesty of his conceit attracted her .
She suspected that he was not happy , and was sufficiently feminine to wish to receive confidences .
In five minutes he was telling her the history of his life .
When they had come to an end , or , to speak more accurately , when Helen intimated by a slight slackening of her attention that they had sat there long enough , Hirst rose , exclaiming , `` So there 's no reason whatever for all this mystery ! ''
`` Miss Vinrace , '' Arthur answered for her , `` has just made a confession ; she 'd no idea that dances could be so delightful . ''
`` It is , '' she replied , emphatically nodding her head .
Helen caught the idea ; seized Miss Allan by the arm , and whirled round the room , now curtseying , now spinning round , now tripping this way and that like a child skipping through a meadow .
He sat in his favourite position with his arms binding his legs together and his chin resting on the top of his knees .
He spoke with conviction , but did not appear to wish for an answer .
Near though they sat , and familiar though they felt , they seemed mere shadows to each other .
`` They ought not to have died , '' she thought .
The tears came to her eyes ; she felt a genuine regret for them , a kind of respect for their youth and beauty , and a kind of shame for herself ; but the tears did not fall ; and she opened one of those innumerable novels which she used to pronounce good or bad , or pretty middling , or really wonderful .
Hewet 's heart leapt , and he noticed the fact .
There was a certain amount of scuffling , entreating , resisting , and laughter from both of them .
`` Well , '' she said , `` d'you want to know any more about me ? ''
`` Why is it that they _won't_ be honest ? ''
The beggars had the sense to scatter . ''
`` If Theresa married Willoughby , '' she remarked , turning the page with a hairpin , `` one does n't see what 's to prevent Rachel -- ''
`` That is , if he takes my advice . ''
`` There 's a clever man in London called John who paints ever so much better than the old masters , '' Mrs. Flushing continued .
Mrs. Flushing cried , `` Ah , ah , ah !
I 'd rather break stones in the road .
She looked at his big head , a disproportionate part of which was occupied by the forehead , and at the direct , severe eyes .
Hirst exclaimed after a moment 's pause .
None of us would dare to behave as that woman behaves . ''
`` For goodness ' sake , Hirst , '' Hewet protested ; `` one might think you were an old cripple of eighty .
You come out on to a cliff and look right down into the sea .
`` Oh no , '' said Helen , with great decision .
She had gradually come to be interested in her niece , and fond of her ; she disliked some things about her very much , she was amused by others ; but she felt her , on the whole , a live if unformed human being , experimental , and not always fortunate in her experiments , but with powers of some kind , and a capacity for feeling .
Hirst had no particular wish to describe them , but when he began to consider them he found himself soothed and strengthened .
One day he thought one thing , another day another .
`` I 've never been so much interested in my life . ''
She then realised that while she had been thinking of Richmond , his eyes had never left her face .
The knowledge of this excited her .
She fixed her gaze upon the pebbles .
`` There 's a very ugly yellow china stand in front of me , called a dumb waiter , on which are three dishes , one for biscuits , one for butter , and one for cheese .
meeting in the drawing-room on Wednesday , so I take the dogs out .
Hampstead Church spire there , Westminster Cathedral over there , and factory chimneys about here .
They 're pale yellow .
Hewet observed her as she considered this .
But the trousers -- they 're not so good .
Can't you imagine the wretched man , after some splendid evening of debauchery , contemplating these garments -- hanging them over the end of the bed , arranging them now in full light , now in shade , and wondering whether they will survive him , or he will survive them ?
Thoughts of suicide cross his mind .
They 're scholars , both of them .
Lady Theo Bingham Bingley , whose bay mare he had the good fortune to stop , is the daughter of a very fine old Tory peer .
They give parties , river parties , parties where you play games .
It ended disastrously for her , poor woman , for the book , as I planned it , was going to end in profound and sordid respectability .
He never succeeds in becoming a real gentleman after all .
That 's the interesting part of it .
`` My idea is that there 's a certain quality of beauty in the past , which the ordinary historical novelist completely ruins by his absurd conventions .
The moon becomes the Regent of the Skies .
I 'm going to treat people as though they were exactly the same as we are .
The advantage is that , detached from modern conditions , one can make them more intense and more abstract then people who live as we do . ''
`` Might n't we call each other Rachel and Terence ? ''
They began to walk rather quickly down the hill on a little path between the olive trees .
Hewet , indeed , might have found excellent material at this time up at the villa for some chapters in the novel which was to be called `` Silence , or the Things People do n't say . ''
Always calm and unemotional in her judgments , Mrs. Ambrose was now inclined to be definitely pessimistic .
How did she know that at this very moment both her children were not lying dead , crushed by motor omnibuses ?
However sincere these views may have been , they were undoubtedly called forth by the irrational state of her niece 's mind .
She was conscious of emotions and powers which she had never suspected in herself , and of a depth in the world hitherto unknown .
Rachel passed from one to another .
`` The women wore them hundreds of years ago , they wear 'em still , '' Mrs. Flushing remarked .
`` My husband rides about and finds 'em ; they don't know what they 're worth , so we get 'em cheap .
To all of which Yarmouth merely replied , `` Yes , ma'am . ''
`` Well , let 's hear them , '' said Hewet , slightly mollified by the prospect of a literary discussion .
The exercise indeed served to clear away the superficial irritations of the morning , but he remained miserable .
It seemed proved beyond a doubt that Rachel was indifferent to him , for she had scarcely looked at him , and she had talked to Mr. Flushing with just the same interest with which she talked to him .
He went over all the evidence for this supposition -- her sudden interest in Hirst 's writing , her way of quoting his opinions respectfully , or with only half a laugh ; her very nickname for him , `` the great Man , '' might have some serious meaning in it .
she cried ; `` they 've no dignity , they 've no courage , they 've nothing but their beastly passions and their brute strength !
`` It makes me angry , '' she explained , drying her eyes .
`` Do n't bother , '' she said , as Miss Allan looked about for some other implement .
She was interested by Miss Allan to the point of forgetting the bottle .
`` After all , I daresay we 've seen all there is to be seen ; and there's the bother of getting there , and whatever they may say it 's bound to be vilely uncomfortable . ''
The time of Elizabeth was only distant from the present time by a moment of space compared with the ages which had passed since the water had run between those banks , and the green thickets swarmed there , and the small trees had grown to huge wrinkled trees in solitude .
A few miles of this river were visible from the top of the mountain where some weeks before the party from the hotel had picnicked .
At intervals for the first twenty miles or so houses were scattered on the bank ; by degrees the houses became huts , and , later still , there was neither hut nor house , but trees and grass , which were seen only by hunters , explorers , or merchants , marching or sailing , but making no settlement .
The morning was now very hot .
His sheet of paper had slipped on to the deck , his head lay back , and he drew a long snoring breath .
She seated herself , opened her parasol , and looked at the river which was barred by the stems of trees .
The heat of the day was going down , and over their cups of tea the Flushings tended to become communicative .
Here were the Flushings talking , talking somewhere high up in the air above him , and he and Rachel had dropped to the bottom of the world together .
`` Would you care for anythin ' but savin ' yourself ?
There 's only two creatures the ordinary woman cares about , '' she continued , `` her child and her dog ; and I do n't believe it 's even two with men .
But what happens in real life , he ?
They had no mother , '' he explained , dropping something of the formality of his tone ; `` and a father -- he was a very delightful man , I 've no doubt , but he cared only for racehorses and Greek statues .
Mr. Flushing exclaimed , turning to Helen .
`` I 'd treat my children just the same if I had any , '' said Mrs. Flushing .
You must admit , Hirst , that a little Italian town even would vulgarise the whole scene , would detract from the vastness -- the sense of elemental grandeur . ''
He swept his hands towards the forest , and paused for a moment , looking at the great green mass , which was now falling silent .
`` I own it makes us seem pretty small -- us , not them . ''
As it was becoming cold he began to pace the deck with Hirst .
Rachel murmured , when they had passed .
Mrs. Ambrose looked and listened obediently enough , but inwardly she was prey to an uneasy mood not readily to be ascribed to any one cause .
She did not like to feel herself the victim of unclassified emotions , and certainly as the launch slipped on and on , in the hot morning sun , she felt herself unreasonably moved .
Her mind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for Ridley , for her children , for far-off things , such as old age and poverty and death .
That , of course , was what came of looking forward to anything ; one was always disappointed .
He blamed Wilfrid Flushing , who was so well dressed and so formal ; he blamed Hewet and Rachel .
He looked at them sitting silent and self-absorbed , and the sight annoyed him .
He drew close to Helen and began to tell her how uncomfortable his night had been , lying on the deck , sometimes too hot , sometimes too cold , and the stars so bright that he could n't get to sleep .
Soon afterwards the launch came gradually to a standstill , and the captain explained to Mr. Flushing that it would be pleasant for the passengers if they now went for a stroll on shore ; if they chose to return within an hour , he would take them on to the village ; if they chose to walk -- it was only a mile or two farther on -- he would meet them at the landing-place .
Nevertheless , they remained uncomfortably apart ; drawn so close together , as she spoke , that there seemed no division between them , and the next moment separate and far away again .
`` D'you realise what you 're doing ? ''
`` She 's young , you're both young ; and marriage -- '' Here she ceased .
`` What can I tell you ? ''
She forced herself to speak .
They went on to sketch an outline of the ideal education -- how their daughter should be required from infancy to gaze at a large square of cardboard painted blue , to suggest thoughts of infinity , for women were grown too practical ; and their son -- he should be taught to laugh at great men , that is , at distinguished successful men , at men who wore ribands and rose to the tops of their trees .
He should in no way resemble ( Rachel added ) St. John Hirst .
Instead of answering him she asked ,
The virtues which Mrs. Ambrose had once believed to exist in free talk between men and women did in truth exist for both of them , although not quite in the measure she prescribed .
What would the hard thing be for them , he wondered ?
Then his thoughts turned to their life in England .
One person all in the dark about another person .
You do n't want me as I want you -- you 're always wanting something else . ''
Helen asked ; anything in the papers ?
O yes , he had a letter from home , a letter from his mother , describing the suicide of the parlour-maid .
`` There 'll have to be an inquest , '' said St. John .
`` They 've hoofed out the prostitute .
( Nobody seems to have asked him what _he_ was up to . )
Something 's got to be done , do n't you agree ? ''
The hypocritical smugness of the English makes my blood boil .
She respected St. John 's morality , which she took far more seriously than any one else did , and now entered into a discussion with him as to the steps that were to be taken to enforce their peculiar view of what was right .
`` I 'm going , '' he repeated .
`` Rachel need n't come unless she wants to . ''
`` I shall be back at four , '' he remarked to Helen , `` when I shall lie down on the sofa and relax all my muscles completely . ''
Then she turned away , saying merely that she would go with Terence , on condition that he did all the talking .
`` Yes , and one has to say something about everybody , '' Miss Allan added .
`` The young people are very keen about it .
It begins again in half an hour . ''
Mr. Pepper was pleased to explain very accurately why there has never been an English salon .
as loud as ever he could , considered that he had done his duty , and walked away again .
she would -- she would do something very dreadful indeed to him .
Arthur Venning suggested that what she must do was to rig up something in the nature of a surprise -- a portrait , for example , of a nice old lady in a lace cap , concealing a bath of cold water , which at a signal could be sprung on Pepper 's head ; or they 'd have a chair which shot him twenty feet high directly he sat on it .
There is a gentle nymph not far from hence ,
`` You go and lie down .
I 'll wait here .
The young lady is not seriously ill , and I am a doctor .
The lady of course is frightened , '' he sneered .
`` I understand that perfectly . ''
After this Terence could no longer stay downstairs .
She then turned to Terence and asked him anxiously some question about a man with mules , which he could not understand .
`` Why does n't he come ?
It ought to have been done days ago .
He could not stay still in one place .
How vast and dark it must be tonight , lying exposed to the wind ; and in all this great space it was curious to think how few the towns were , and how small little rings of light , or single glow-worms he figured them , scattered here and there , among the swelling uncultivated folds of the world .
What did anything matter ?
As usual , Dr. Lesage was sulky in his manner and very short in his answers .
he replied , looking at him in an odd way , `` She has a chance of life . ''
he shrieked , trying to rush back to her .
Something had passed from the world .
It seemed to her strangely empty .
She was unusually subdued .
She suffered it to go on for a few minutes , leaning both elbows on the table , and leaving her soup untouched , when she exclaimed suddenly , `` I do n't know how you feel , but I can simply think of nothing else ! ''
Susan replied , `` Yes -- is n't it perfectly awful ?
Old Mrs. Paley , hitherto contented with her soup , here intimated , by raising one hand to her ear , that she wished to know what was being said .
Brought thus to a standstill for a moment , Arthur and Susan congratulated Hughling Elliot upon his convalescence , -- he was down , cadaverous enough , for the first time , -- and Mr. Perrott took occasion to say a few words in private to Evelyn .
He was very pale , and seemed unable to say any more .
`` Of course I care for you , '' she began , rushing her words out in a hurry ; `` I should be a brute if I did n't .
I wish you did n't care for me in that way .
Are you sure you do ? ''
Mrs. Elliot was an expert at knitting , and disclaimed a compliment to that effect with evident pride .
`` Are you afraid of dyin ' ? ''
Without any sense of disloyalty to Terence and Rachel he ceased to think about either of them .
