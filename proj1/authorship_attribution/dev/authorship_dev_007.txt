Mr. Butteridge also involved himself passionately in a tangle of disputes for the possession of a great number of valuable money prizes .
Some of these had been offered so long ago as 1906 for successful mechanical flight .
By the time of Mr. Butteridge 's success a really very considerable number of newspapers , tempted by the impunity of the pioneers in this direction , had pledged themselves to pay in some cases , quite overwhelming sums to the first person to fly from Manchester to Glasgow , from London to Manchester , one hundred miles , two hundred miles in England , and the like .
`` See you to-morrer . ''
The two white figures on scarlet wheels came upon them out of the infinite along the sands from Littlestone , grew nearer and larger and more audible , honk-honking and emitting weird cries , and generally threatening liveliness of the most aggressive type .
He threw out a bag of ballast , and was astonished to find himself careering up through the air very rapidly .
`` They 're running the water out of the ballonette already . ''
This was the position of affairs when the Vaterland appeared in the sky .
The Bremen and the Weimar , both hit in several places , were going west by south and away from her .
The American fleet , headed by the Theodore Roosevelt , was crossing behind them , pounding them in succession , steaming in between them and the big modern Furst Bismarck , which was coming up from the west .
The noise of the guns , too , confused him , they no longer seemed to boom ; they went whack , whack , whack , whack , and each faint flash made his heart jump in anticipation of the instant impact .
For the most part they presented empty decks , but here and there little knots of men sheltered behind steel bulwarks .
The long , agitated noses of their big guns , jetting thin transparent flashes and the broadside activity of the quick-firers , were the chief facts in this bird's-eye view .
The Americans being steam-turbine ships , had from two to four blast funnels each ; the Germans lay lower in the water , having explosive engines , which now for some reason made an unwonted muttering roar .
Because of their steam propulsion , the American ships were larger and with a more graceful outline .
And in that pause in the uproar too , the sun rose , the dark waters became luminously blue , and a torrent of golden light irradiated the world .
The cloud veil had vanished as if by magic , and the whole immensity of the German air-fleet was revealed in the sky ; the air-fleet stooping now upon its prey .
And I 'm gettin ' giddy .
I did n't mind a bit being up in that balloon at first , but all this looking down and floating over things and smashing up people , it 's getting on my nerves .
As he did so a volley of rifle and revolver shots was fired from the upper windows of the huge apartment building that stands between the University and Riverside Drive .
Just for the instant before that explosion the universe seemed to be standing still in a shadowless glare .
`` Another waterfall I knew . ''
Round they swooped once again over the Canadian Fall , over the waste of waters eastward , until they were distant and small , and then round and back , hurrying , bounding , swooping towards the one gaping spectator .
It looked as though it had floated down into a position of rest .
He ceased to be a solitary representative of humanity in a vast and violent and incomprehensible universe , and became once more a social creature , a man in a world of other men .
For an instant these two were terrible , then they seemed sweet and desirable as brothers .
His native Cockney freedom flowed too generously for him to think of that , and surely the Asiatic fleets had purged all such trivial differences .
A heavy-necked man in a straw hat , who was chewing something , stopped the machine with a touch , and they all turned their eyes on Bert .
`` Mor 'n a WHAT ? ''
For three hundred years and more the long steadily accelerated diastole of Europeanised civilisation had been in progress : towns had been multiplying , populations increasing , values rising , new countries developing ; thought , literature , knowledge unfolding and spreading .
It seemed but a part of the process that every year the instruments of war were vaster and more powerful , and that armies and explosives outgrew all other growing things ... .
They came to a narrow railroad bridge and presently to a mono-rail train standing in the track on its safety feet .
In one parish he would find the large house burnt , the vicarage wrecked , evidently in violent conflict for some suspected and perhaps imaginary store of food unburied dead everywhere , and the whole mechanism of the community at a standstill .
But at any time such a village would be liable to a raid of Asiatics or Africans or such-like air-pirates , demanding petrol and alcohol or provisions .
The price of its order was an almost intolerable watchfulness and tension .
Bill was perfunctorily buried , and Bert 's Vigilance Committee ( for so it continued to be called ) reigned in his stead .
`` What a splendid idea , '' she cried , `` that wistaria !
( A fragment of the conversation in Lady Beach-Mandarin 's returning automobile may be recorded in a parenthesis here .
What do you mean by it ? ''
`` I 've heard of that . ''
`` There 'appened to be copies in the pantry , me lady , '' he said .
`` We can't imagine 'ow they got there ; someone must have brought them in , but 'ere they are quite at your service , me lady . ''
He paused for a discreet moment .
`` But surely -- she would have written , '' said Mr. Brumley , troubled and disappointed , regarding an aching gap to the left of his chair , a gap upon which a pathetic little card bearing Lady Harman 's name still lay obliquely .
But you have already had occasion to remark a change in Mr. Brumley's bearing and attitude that carries him far from the kindly and humorous conservatism of his earlier work .
In the chilly ill-flavoured solitude of her prison cell and with a mind quickened by meagre and distasteful fare , Lady Harman had ample leisure to reflect upon many things , she had already fully acquainted herself with the greater proportion of Mr. Brumley 's published works , and she found the utmost difficulty in reconciling the flushed impassioned quality of his few words of appeal , with the moral assumptions of his published opinions .
On the whole she was inclined to think that her memory had a little distorted what he had said .
Or what you were doing . ''
`` I did n't know where you were .
Naturally he wanted to take charge of everything and leave nothing to me .
And it 's been necessary to do things .
But he sees now so clearly , he wrote to me , such a fair letter -- an unusual letter -- quite different from when he talks -- it surprised me , telling me he wanted me to feel free , that he meant to make me -- to arrange things that is , so that I should feel free and more able to go about as I pleased .
Already that undocumented Magna Charta was manifestly not working upon the lines she had anticipated .
The glosses Sir Isaac put upon it were extensive and remarkable and invariably in the direction of restricting her liberties and resuming controls she had supposed abandoned .
And few people knew how uncertain her liberties were .
Sir Isaac was the victim of an increasing irritability , at times he had irrational outbursts of distrust that would culminate in passionate outbreaks and scenes that were truncated by an almost suffocating breathlessness .
On several occasions he was on the verge of quarrelling violently with her visitors , and he would suddenly oblige her to break engagements , pour abuse upon her and bring matters back to the very verge of her first revolt .
The plans revealed in every case a site depth as great as the frontage , and the utmost ingenuity had been used to utilize as much space as possible .
`` She can get her breakfast with a bit of bacon or a sausage for two shillings a week , and she can get her high tea , with cold meat , good potted salmon , shrimp paste , jam and cetera , for three-and-six a week .
That means she can get along on about twelve-and-six a week , comfortable , read the papers , have a book out of the library ... .
The sort of thing they have now is one room , dingy , badly fitted , extra for coals .
She expressed the rest of her ideas with a gesture of the hands .
`` Exactly , '' said Mr. Brumley , with the gesture of one who recovers a thread .
Complaints and incidents drifted towards definite scenes and `` situations . ''
`` Damn it ! ''
he cried , and his panting breath quickened ; `` the thing 's got to end .
He was very moist and his bowler was flagging .
`` Do n't argue , '' signalled the doctor from the end of Sir Isaac 's bed .
She was going to write a telegram that she knew would bring Crappen headlong -- to disinherit her absolutely .
And -- it suddenly struck her -- her husband had trusted her to write it .
She was going to do what he had trusted her to do ... .
But it was absurd .
`` Mr. Brumley , '' she said , looking up at him , `` have you no thought for our Hostels ? ''
He disregarded her shy eyes , giving way to his gathered wrath .
`` Yes -- Do n't you call your little ones -- -- ? ''
`` Whaddyer talking about ? ''
said Banghurst from his littered desk , eyeing the sheets with apprehensive animosity .
`` What 's he done ? ''
But Mrs. Bunting , you know , would never have seen it like that .
`` It takes me a little by surprise . ''
`` You would n't believe me if I told you , '' said Melville .
Please_ , '' was the irresistible message from Mrs. Bunting .
My cousin took the early train and arrived at Sandgate in the forenoon .
`` He is -- he is a man with rather a strong imagination . ''
But it is something -- something that tears at the very fabric of this daily life . ''
`` Mr. Melville , I do n't see where your 'impossible ' comes in . ''
The valet 's evidence is precise , but has an air of being irrelevant .
But it was clear to us the thing for us two to go upon was not the good of the present nor the evil , but the effort and the dream of the finer order , the fuller life , the banishment of suffering , to come .
It is the denial that chance impulse and individual will and happening constitute the only possible methods by which things may be done in the world .
It is an assertion that things are in their nature orderly , that things may be computed , may be calculated upon and foreseen .
Half-an-hour later another milk cart arrives and delivers milk , first on this side of the street and then on that , until seven houses have been supplied , and then he departs .
The scandal of our milk supply is an open one ; it is more and more evident that so long as Private Ownership rules the milk trade , we can never be sure that at every point in the course of the milk from cow to consumer there will not creep in harmful and dishonest profit-making elements .
We try to reduce this tribute by inspection .
It would be much simpler to set to work directly , employ and train these private persons , and run the dairies and milk distribution ourselves .
A practising doctor should be in lifelong perpetual war against pain and disease , just as a campaigning soldier is continually alert and serving .
But existing conditions will not permit that .
Existing conditions require the doctor to get his fee at any cost ; if he goes about doing work for nothing , they punish him with shabbiness and incapacitating need , they forbid his marriage or doom his wife and children to poverty and unhappiness .
A doctor _must_ make money whatever else he does or does not do ; he _must_ secure his fees .
To expect him to behave like a public servant whose income and outlook are secure , or like a priest whose church will never let him want or starve , is ridiculous .
Why should the press blame the poor doctor of a poor neighbourhood because a moneyless man goes short of medical attendance , when it does not for one moment blame Mr. J. D. Rockefeller because a poor man goes short of oil , or the Duke of Devonshire because tramps need lodgings in Eastbourne ?
One never reads this sort of paragraph : --
It is no doubt interesting to discuss the benefits of vaccination and the justice and policy of its public compulsion , to debate whether one should eat meat or confine oneself to a vegetable dietary , whether the overhead or the slot system is preferable for tramway traction , whether steamboats are needed on the Thames in winter , and whether it is wiser to use metal or paper for money ; but none of these things have anything to do with the principles of Socialism .
Again and again he will meet with it .
So that it most flourishes eastwardly , where men , it would seem , are least energetic and constructive , and it explodes or dies on American soil .
It has made the British mind as a whole `` administrative . ''
A local governing body for too small an area or elected upon an unsound franchise _cannot_ be efficient .
But obviously before you can transfer property from private to collective control you must have something in the way of a governing institution which has a reasonably good chance of developing into an efficient controlling body .
All sorts of things may happen to the newspaper of to-day even in the near future , it can not but be felt that in its present form it is an extremely transitory phenomenon , that it no longer embodies and rules public thought as it did in the middle and later Victorian period , and that a separation of public discussion from the news sheet is already in progress .
The newspaper appears to be in the opening throes of a period of fundamental change .
And if the lady wants to buy books , music , artistic bric-a-brac , or what not , she will find the big store displaying and selling all these things on commission for the municipal or private producers all over the world ... .
He was treacherous , it must be written , and yet he was , one must confess , a singularly attractive man .
`` 'That we on our part -- -- ? '
`` Just consider that .
I ca n't explain .
It keeps on and I know it keeps on -- although I ca n't for the life of me tell how ... . ''
Wonderful fellows , these stokers !
The third instrument that was pitched upon by Briggs for the trial was the strange trumpet that lay at the bottom of the window , the trumpet that you , who have read the Introduction , know was the trumpet for the Last Trump .
And Hoskin tried and tried again , and then , blowing desperately , hurt his ears .
But he could get no sound from the trumpet .
So the young men , after making a suitable deposit ( which , as you shall hear , was presently confiscated ) , went off with the trumpet , proposing to clean it next day at the works and polish it with the peculiarly excellent brass polish employed upon the honk-honk horns of the firm .
And He is watching us now .
Cynicism is humour in ill-health .
It would have been far more difficult to tell the story of how a multitude of commonplace people were changed by a half-dubious perception that God was indeed close at hand to them , a perception that they would sometimes struggle with and deny , sometimes realize overwhelmingly ; it would have been a beautiful , pitiful , wonderful story , and it may be if Boon had lived he would have written it .
But he was too ill for that much of writing , and the tired pencil turned to the easier course ... .
Nothing in the Country shall be moved or set aside deliberately to facilitate the firing of guns .
( III ) A gun is in action if there are at least four men of its own side within six inches of it .
At less than one foot , the cavalry loses one man for every fifteen charged , and the infantry three men for each sabre charging .
`` Yes , I should _think_ sulphur . ''
He grasped now how profoundly the order of the universe had changed for him .
He had come right away to this amazing experience , _without even saying a word to his cousin Jane_ !
Then , thank goodness !
Redwood and Cossar were coming out of the inaudible darknesses , and Redwood was calling `` Bensington ! ''
swore Cossar , `` where 's everything got to ? ''
He strode a step towards the black shadows on the hillside that masked the holes and stood staring .
`` If they _have_ dragged him in -- - ! ''
And to get what ?
-- a proletariat of hungry giants .
Winds up with a very serious passage , says even if this wild suggestion -- mere passing fancy of mine , you know , and misinterpreted at that -- this wild suggestion about the schools comes to nothing , that does n't end the matter .
This is a strange food , so strange as to seem to him almost wicked .
A slight bouncing noise proclaimed the presence of Winkles .
You know , Redwood , I 'm not sure whether there is not something almost -- _treasonable_ ... ''
Thank God He has a use for you ! ''
And with the zest of his age in such proceedings , he severed one by one the heads from the bodies of Mr. Carrington 's assailants .
He looked habitually and essentially mellow , as though he had been a mellow baby born into a mellow class , a ripe and juicy little boy .
He waved a plump palm towards it .
His burthen sang out again .
`` Then _let 's , '' _ said the second brother .
He stopped for a moment .
`` I have never been beyond the seas . ''
`` I argued with him a little .
`` I woff hungry , '' he said , with his mouth full .
`` You lea ' me alone , '' said Caddles , facing the breathless crowd .
`` I ain't done anything to you . ''
At that time he was unarmed , for he had left his chalk chopper in Regent 's Park .
Presently with a spasm of sick anger he saw the now familiar form of a policeman astride the garden wall .
Caddles gave an inarticulate growl .
Bang , bang , bang , went the heavy guns , and smash !
the shattered wall , the soil and subsoil of the garden flew .
Something flew with it , that left red drops on one of the shooter 's hands .
But young Caddles , already shot twice through the body , had spun about to find who it was had hit him so heavily in the back .
He was stung and wrenched by pain .
`` The fact is I did n't see it in that light before , but this here Giant what 's been going on with the Princess , you know , is this man 's son . ''
Then he drew himself up -- through all their interview both men stood -- and looked away from Redwood , and began to fence and justify .
`` No , '' said Redwood , struggling to get back to the old footing .
`` Even more so -- to be mothers of a new race ... ''
The world is a supersaturated solution of the will-for-peace , and there is nothing for it to crystallise upon .
There are many more people , and there is much more intelligence concentrated upon the manufacture of cigarettes or hairpins than upon the establishment of a permanent world peace .
There are a few special secretaries employed by philanthropic Americans , and that is about all .
There has been no provision made even for the emoluments of these gentlemen when universal peace is attained ; presumably they would lose their jobs .
Such an establishment as a workhouse or an old-fashioned monastery , living upon the produce of its own farming and supplying all its own labour , would be least embarrassed amidst the general perplexity .
The nature of the State has altered profoundly in the last century .
What were called `` economic forces '' had unrestricted play .
Only that excuse , so popular in England , will not prevent a smash if we stick to the old methods under the stresses ahead .
I do not believe that among women of the same social origins and the same educational quality there can exist side by side entirely distinct schools of costume , deportment , and behaviour based on entirely divergent views of life .
I do not think that men can be trained to differentiate between different sorts of women , sorts of women they will often be meeting simultaneously , and to treat this one with frankness and fellowship and that one with awe passion and romantic old-world gallantry .
All sorts of intermediate types -- the majority of women will be intermediate types -- will complicate the problem .
This conflict of the citizen-woman ideal with the loveliness-woman ideal , which was breaking out very plainly in the British suffrage movement before the war , will certainly return after the war , and I have little doubt which way the issue will fall .
The human being is going to carry it against the sexual being .
The struggle is going to be extensive and various and prolonged , but in the serious years ahead the serious type must , I feel , win .
Most of the other things are inevitable .
In this chapter I propose to speculate a little about the future development of these four great States , whose destinies are likely to be much more closely interwoven than their past histories have been .
I believe that the stars in their courses tend to draw these States together into a dominant peace alliance , maintaining the peace of the world .
There may be other stars in that constellation , Italy , Japan , a confederated Latin America , for example ; I do not propose to deal with that possibility now , but only to dwell upon the development of understandings and common aims between France , Russia , and the English-speaking States .
Now the next class of foreign `` possession '' is that in which the French and Belgians and Italians are most interested .
`` Well , he told my secret .
There was that big Fawcett -- you remember him ?
You were n't there by any chance ?
Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky , and then suddenly , as it hung over India , its light had been veiled .
The whole land seemed a-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair , and a breath of cold wind , and a gathering of clouds , out of the cooling air .
Men looking up , near blinded , at the star , saw that a black disc was creeping across the light .
It was the moon , coming between the star and the earth .
And even as men cried to God at this respite , out of the East with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun .
`` 'War , ' he said , as if he were speaking to himself , and then turned slowly from me and walked away .
`` What were they like ? ''
Some escaped northward , some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads ; many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward .
We had landed at Salerno , and we had been turned back from Cava , and we had tried to cross towards Taranto by a pass over Mount Alburno , but we had been driven back for want of food , and so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum , where those great temples stand alone .
I had some vague idea that by Paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something , and take once more to sea .
And there it was the battle overtook us .
The woman 's heart was cold within her .
Where did you get it ? ''
When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had been a little scared about the consequences of his act .
His plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the station , and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide .
`` My time will come , '' he said .
He spoke of the beauties of sight , of watching the mountains , of the sky and the sunrise , and they heard him with amused incredulity that presently became condemnatory .
He saw that in some manner he shocked them , and gave up that aspect of the matter altogether , and tried to show them the practical value of sight .
They mocked Nunez when Pedro did not arrive , and afterwards , when he asked Pedro questions to clear his character , Pedro denied and outfaced him , and was afterwards hostile to him .
Horrocks , still silent , sat down abruptly in the chair by her little work-table .
The group round the cabman 's shelter became animated .
`` Whip up ! ''
`` I suppose it 's troublesome .
Still ... you see , nothing ever happens to me .
When I was a little boy I never had accidents .
I wonder how it feels to have something happen to you , something really remarkable .
For a moment he thought impossible things .
We put a pipe in his hands -- he almost poked his eye out with it -- and lit it .
But he could n't taste anything .
I 've since found it 's the same with me -- I do n't know if it 's the usual case -- that I can not enjoy tobacco at all unless I can see the smoke .
He struck at it with his hand , and turning his head saw two men approaching him .
Then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness , that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself , and that it behoved him to keep silent about it .
He must keep himself in hand .
He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand .
But as the night waned the fever grew upon him , and the very dread he had of seeing the moth made him see it .
About five , just as the dawn was grey , he tried to get out of bed and catch it , though his leg was afire with pain .
The nurse had to struggle with him .
The canoe was now approaching the land .
Far beyond , dim and almost cloudlike in texture , rose the mountains , like suddenly frozen waves .
The sea was still save for an almost imperceptible swell .
I felt a passionate impatience ; but the things grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change .
What was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable night of space ?
`` We 'd better get out of this , '' said Mr. Fison , who was trembling violently .
Mr. Fison had expressed the common feeling beyond amendment .
`` But I do n't know anything about it , you know . ''
I repeated it , for my own satisfaction .
Then ( rather puzzled ) I turned to my portmanteau .
Involuntarily I clutched my diaphragm and averted my head ( as is the way with them ) .
At that the candle on the wardrobe went out , and the one I had relit in the alcove followed .
He walked away from his unhappy home , and , sick not only of his own existence but of everybody else 's , turned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town , and , crossing the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to Starling 's Cottages , was presently alone in the damp pine woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation .
`` If a man values a woman , '' said Mr. Clarence , lounging back in the arm-chair , `` he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her .
`` But I was a fool to 'ave 'im .
If it 'ad n't been for my father , we should n't 'ave 'ad not a carriage to our wedding . ''
At that moment he was genial .
And it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure .
In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before , he shouted , `` My house .
So much for the essential facts of this very singular story .
This view of the crystals as _en rapport_ was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace , and to me at least it seems extremely plausible ...
`` A proper course , '' said Mr. Maydig , `` a very proper course -- altogether the proper course . ''
If they really _are_ ...
If they really are all they seem to be . ''
He dug his fingers into the mould , closed his eyes , and said `` Off ! ''
And I 'm prepared to prove it up to the hilt . ''
`` There 's Darwin , '' he said , going off at a tangent .
`` _He'll_ catch it !
-- that tall , important-looking man trying to catch the eye of the Lord God , that 's the Duke .
`` It do n't leave much for ambition , does it ? ''
I was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours , as it seemed , until the shindy of the arrival began .
`` And I do n't remember waking up .
I do n't remember dressing that day .
I know I found myself in my office , with my letters all slit open in front of me , and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there , seeing that in reality I was sitting , stunned , in that Paestum Temple with a dead woman in my arms .
I read my letters like a machine .
I have forgotten what they were about . ''
Great birds that fought and tore . ''
The master was seized with a sudden , unreasonable impatience .
he cried ; `` get on !
What do these things matter ?
And so we came out upon the Leas .
`` Lord , look _here_ ! ''
`` It 's less than a hundred days to your birthday , Gibbles , '' I said , and laid my hand on the door-handle .
I tried to find out what they cost , but the shopman did not heed me .
He had got Gip now ; he had got him away from my finger ; he had embarked upon the exposition of all his confounded stock , and nothing was going to stop him .
Presently I saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like jealousy that Gip had hold of this person 's finger as usually he has hold of mine .
No doubt the fellow was interesting , I thought , and had an interestingly faked lot of stuff , really _good_ faked stuff , still -- --
In which case it would need a Trust Magnate -- -- ''
`` Did you see dat ? ''
I believe now , as I believed at the moment of telling , that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me .
But whether he himself saw , or only thought he saw , whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of a fantastic dream , I can not pretend to guess .
The next day in the play interval I found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys , half teasing , and wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden .
He was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below .
`` Look you here , you people , '' he said .
He looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind -- unclimbable because of its smooth plastering , but withal pierced with many little doors , and at the approaching line of seekers .
He was drenched in pity for himself and her .
she seems to ask .
and stifles their protests with a clamorous woman and a painful piano .
`` Putting it in another way , one might say that the kind of story that Ovid is so fond of describing , the affairs of Daphne and Io , for instance , are fables of the same thing : an interlude of sentiment and then a change into something new and domesticated , rooted , fixed , and bounded in . ''
He waved his hand towards a neat array of silver and white pasteboard .
`` 'Jemima Smith , ' with an arrow through the Smith , and 'Podger ' written above it , and on the opposite side 'Mr and Mrs John Podger . '
That is where it has me , George . ''
`` It would be like him if he did , '' I said .
`` I 'd be willing enough to wait , '' said my uncle ; `` but I 'm not the only party in this affair . ''
But there is a return trade .
The French attack resolves itself into a triple system of gunfire .
The first wave of attack fights , destroys , or disarms the surviving Germans and sends them back across the open to the French trenches .
During my journey in Italy and France I met several men who were keenly interested in business organisation .
`` I sha n't interfere any more .
The boys have got to run it some day , and they had better get their experience while they 're young and capable of learning by it .
The impression I have of the present mental process in the European communities is that while the official class and the _rentier_ class is thinking very poorly and inadequately and with a merely obstructive disposition ; while the churches are merely wasting their energies in futile self-advertisement ; while the labour mass is suspicious and disposed to make terms for itself rather than come into any large schemes of reconstruction that will abolish profit as a primary aim in economic life , there is still a very considerable movement towards such a reconstruction .
Nothing is so misleading as a careless analogy .
In the dead years that followed the Napoleonic wars , which are often quoted as a precedent for expectation now , the spirit of collective service was near its minimum ; it was never so strong and never so manifestly spreading and increasing as it is to-day .
For my third instance I would step from a matter as small as three market towns and the grazing of a few thousand head of sheep to a matter as big as the world .
What is going to happen to the shipping of the world after this war ?
The Germans , with that combination of cunning and stupidity which baffles the rest of mankind , have set themselves to destroy the mercantile marine not merely of Britain and France but of Norway and Sweden , Holland , and all the neutral countries .
People do not realise that a time may come when Germany will be glad and eager to give Russia , France and Italy all that they require of her , when Great Britain may be quite content to let her allies make an advantageous peace and herself still go on fighting Germany .
She does not intend to let that furtively created German mercantile marine ship or coal or exist upon the high seas -- so long as it can be used as an economic weapon against her .
Neither Britain nor France nor Italy can tolerate anything of the sort .
The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep .
The match went out , the cigarette was put down unlit .
The man was certainly very still .
Then he stole on tiptoe out of the room , glancing at his companion after each elaborate pace .
`` Often wanted to come , '' said Isbister ; `` but business nowadays is too serious a thing for much holiday keeping .
He caught at the table to save himself , knocking one of the glasses to the floor -- it rang but did not break -- and sat down in one of the armchairs .
He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it .
`` Everything you say , everything you do , convinces me -- of some great issue in which I am concerned .
Yes , I know .
There is a city , a multitude -- .
He heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified , and this shout was echoed by a shout from below .
He felt that he was no longer gliding along the cable but falling with it .
He felt something soft against his extended hand , and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm ...
The appearance of the houses and ways , the appearance of the packed masses changed , became a confusion of vivid lights and leaping shadows .
Voices were crying together one thing .
In this dancing death of the lights the area of the street had suddenly become a monstrous struggle .
`` Did you say -- there had not been what ?
-- for a gross of years ? ''
Other shouting men followed .
He had a doubt whether all were speaking English .
Scraps floated to him , scraps like Pigeon English , like 'nigger ' dialect , blurred and mangled distortions .
And if that was so , how did it affect him ?
The fight is over .
His own part in the development of this time he now knew clearly enough .
His Council at last had ceased even to trouble to have its decrees endorsed by the constitutional authorities , and he a motionless , sunken , yellow-skinned figure had lain , neither dead nor living , recognisably and immediately Master of the Earth .
`` Not land yet .
I want to learn more of this machine . ''
Then he answered , `` They are complex , Sire . ''
When the aeropile was rising again he drew a deep breath and replied .
`` I am still hardly more than a girl , '' she said .
`` But to me the world seems full of wretchedness .
The world has changed .
There is one thing . ''
On either side of the passage , which was silent and padded , as if to deaden the footfall , were narrow little doors , their size and arrangement suggestive of the cells of a Victorian prison .
Elaborate apparatus watched the atmosphere and rang a bell far away in the central office at the slightest departure from the optimum of temperature and moisture .
A system of such _creches_ had almost entirely replaced the hazardous adventures of the old-world nursing .
The attendant presently called Graham 's attention to the wet nurses , a vista of mechanical figures , with arms , shoulders and breasts of astonishingly realistic modelling , articulation , and texture , but mere brass tripods below , and having in the place of features a flat disc bearing advertisements likely to be of interest to mothers .
The man in yellow came out of the nearer shadows into the circle of light .
`` If we could stop them another hour ! ''
cried the man in yellow .
There was a little difficulty .
In return for which restraint on the part of the eager and adventurous , the calm patient man was prepared in his thoughts to fly high and go far .
Without giving any guarantee , of course , that he might not ultimately return to the comfortable point of inaction from which he started .
What I said about that was near the truth of things ... .
Before you realize it your affections are involved .
`` You can put it in that way if you like . ''
I was slightly wounded by a stray shell near Arras while I was inspecting some plant I had set up , and also I was hit by a stray knighthood .
So my name is now Sir Richmond Hardy .
My friend is a very distinguished Harley Street physician .
His name is Dr. Martineau .
He is really a very wise and learned man indeed .
He's stimulated me tremendously .
`` This IS the confessional .
Look at the thing frankly .
Can you deny it ?
You 're a stray man looking for a mistress .
She is quite prepared to fall in love with you . ''
`` We are afraid , '' she said .
`` It 's too vast .
This young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments .
When they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest , then it was n't so necessary .
He explained that he wanted her first to see Shaftesbury , a little old Wessex town that was three or four hundred years older than Salisbury , perched on a hill , a Saxon town , where Alfred had gathered his forces against the Danes and where Canute , who had ruled over all Scandinavia and Iceland and Greenland , and had come near ruling a patch of America , had died .
And at Glastonbury also there were the ruins of a great Benedictine church and abbey that had once rivalled Salisbury .
`` She is wonderful .
Yet he wished to meet the requirements of this lady if he could .
A man of genius . ''
From the earliest ages man 's mind has found little or no difficulty in the idea of something essential to the personality , a soul or a spirit or both , existing apart from the body and continuing after the destruction of the body , and being still a person and an individual .
That is the idea of theological Christianity , as distinguished from the Christianity of simple faith .
It finds a sanction in the new intelligence , and an inspiration in the finer sentiments of our generation , but the glow which chiefly illumines it is the glow of the great vision of a happier earth .
This is the same reality .
There are a number of people closely in touch with those who have found the new religion who , biased probably by a dread of too complete a break with Christianity , have adopted a theogony which is very reminiscent of Gnosticism and of the Paulician , Catharist , and kindred sects to which allusion has already been made .
He , who is called in this book God , they would call God-the-Son or Christ , or the Logos ; and what is here called the Darkness or the Veiled Being , they would call God-the-Father .
And what we speak of here as Life , they would call , with a certain disregard of the poor brutes that perish , Man .
* And this great adventurer out of the hearts of man that we here call God , they would present as the same with that teacher from Galilee who was crucified at Jerusalem .
And again quite parallel with these personal problems is the trouble of the artist between the market and vulgar fame on the one hand and his divine impulse on the other .
Therewith the whole position of the conforming sceptic is changed .
What compensatory good can a priest pretend to do when his primary business is the truth and his method a lie ?
When I saw them standing round me , it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances , in trying to revive the sensation of fear .
In the centre was a hillock or tumulus , surmounted by a scorched hawthorn .
Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest , with yellow tongues already writhing from it , completely encircling the space with a fence of fire .
At first I did not realize their blindness , and struck furiously at them with my bar , in a frenzy of fear , as they approached me , killing one and crippling several more .
The clinging hands slipped from me .
The darkness presently fell from my eyes .
'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me .
But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones .
The door at the lower end opened , and she glided quietly up the laboratory , back foremost , and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered .
said Mr. Marvel , and his face grew white amidst its patches .
his lips repeated noiselessly .
He remained staring about him , rotating slowly backwards .
`` I could have _swore_ I heard a voice , '' he whispered .
`` That wo n't do , '' said the policeman ; `` that 's murder . ''
`` I always like to get something about me before I eat , '' said the Invisible Man , with a full mouth , eating greedily .
My first stroke of luck !
Quite a clot over there .
It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive ... .
I suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away .
'Who 's that ? '
I dashed around a corner and came full tilt -- a faceless figure , mind you !
asking what was 'up , ' and giving one another advice how to catch me .
`` Art pots , '' suggested Kemp .
He put his hand in his pocket , failed to find what he wanted , and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs .
But I did not follow him .
`` What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock ?
Kemp made three swift steps to the door , and forthwith the Invisible Man -- his legs had vanished -- sprang to his feet with a shout .
Kemp flung the door open .
`` I 'm getting nervous , '' said Kemp .
So he lapses into a dream , the undying wonderful dream of his life .
And though Kemp has fished unceasingly , no human being save the landlord knows those books are there , with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein .
The general effect was after this fashion :
`` Sorry , '' said Mr. Polly , `` if I am intrudaceous .
She stared for a moment , and then went off into peals of laughter .
`` You _are_ funny ! ''
`` Shut up ! ''
`` One or two likely ones .
But it takes time . ''
He turned to her .
`` Thought my bicycle was on fire , '' he said .
`` It 's a home . ''
She rose and made as if to take Mr. Polly 's arm .
That girl 's a treasure of treasures , and always has been ever since she tried to nurse her own little sister , being but three at the time , and fell the full flight of stairs from top to bottom , no hurt that any outward eye 'as even seen , but always ready and helpful , always tidying and busy .
He had nerved himself for throat-cutting , but this was fire !
He seemed transported to some strange country , and would have felt no surprise if the old labourer he came upon leaning silently over a gate had addressed him in an unfamiliar tongue ... .
said Mr. Polly , and leant over the bar .
`` New mustard , '' said Mr. Polly .
`` I 'm odd , all right .
`` You got to blurry well shift , '' he said .
The best , the kindliest , if not the justest course is surely to leave untold such things as Mr. Polly would manifestly have preferred untold .
A momentary faintness came upon him .
Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals whose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live , and a number whose individuals whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live .
And on the whole the former sort will live longer , bear more offspring , and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter , and so generation by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction .
There may be many forces at work varying , destroying and preserving species , about which science may still be unaware or undecided , but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought .
The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on which the wind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm for days together , so that sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use .
In the great valleys of both these regions agricultural city states of brownish peoples were growing up , but in India they do not seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly as the city states of Mesopotamia or Egypt .
Chinese history has still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much legendary matter .
Probably China at this time was in advance of India .
Beautiful bronze vessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist , and their beauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries of civilization must have preceded their manufacture .
But this was a new idea , this God of the Jews , in the heavens , high above priests and sacrifices .
They were a people exalted by their sense of a common destiny .
This belief saturated them all when they returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon .
It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off from the world at large .
The rest of the world went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had been sown .
Thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown lay hidden .
In a sense the experiment failed .
There were armed slaves .
And also there were learned slaves .
The conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities of Greece , North Africa and Asia Minor ; and they brought in many highly educated captives .
A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian , and slave secretaries and learned men .
In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a renascent Persia .
In Gaul , Spain and Italy and in Dacia the Latin speech still prevailed in locally distorted forms , but in Britain and east of the Rhine languages of the German group ( or in Bohemia a Slavonic language , Czech ) were the common speech .
Had it not been for the monks and Christian missionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether .
He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle , who had already once made the journey .
The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously .
In 1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa to India , and in 1515 there were Portuguese ships in Java .
In 1519 Magellan , a Portuguese sailor in Spanish employment , sailed out of Seville westward with five ships , of which one , the _Vittoria_ , came back up the river to Seville in 1522 , the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world .
Thirty-one men were aboard her , survivors of two-hundred-and-eighty who had started .
He also amused himself with mechanical toys , by listening to music or sermons , and by attending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him .
The death of the Empress , to whom he was greatly attached , had turned his mind towards religion , which in his case took a punctilious and ceremonial form ; every Friday in Lent he scourged himself with the rest of the monks with such good will as to draw blood .
The appearance of Protestant teaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury .
[ Illustration : CROMWELL DISSOLVES THE LONG PARLIAMENT AND SO BECOMES AUTOCRAT OF THE ENGLISH REPUBLIC ]
And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people .
There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic .
The youth of France poured into the Republican armies ; a new and wonderful song spread through the land , a song that still warms the blood like wine , the Marseillaise .
It had been exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from England upon the execution of Louis , and it declared war against England .
Canada , as we have noted , was the first of the British possessions to respond richly to the new economic possibilities that the new methods of transport were opening .
Presently the republics of South America , and particularly the Argentine Republic , began to feel in their cattle trade and coffee growing the increased nearness of the European market .
Hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted the European powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had been gold or other metals , spices , ivory , or slaves .
It was plain that Great Britain and Holland and Portugal were reaping a great and growing commercial advantage from their very considerable control of tropical and sub-tropical products .
After 1871 Germany , and presently France and later Italy , began to look for unannexed raw-material areas , or for Oriental countries capable of profitable modernization .
`` It 's not a cert , you know , '' he remarked .
The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs , to occupy epochs .
`` How long have I been asleep ? ''
`` But those voices .
`` This is one of the city ways for various public services .
Howard appeared beneath , walking quickly across the polished floor towards them .
As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar movements , apparently of a ceremonious nature .
Your life is in danger here .
We learned but just in time .
And everything is ready .
The whole city shouts against the Council .
He wiped the blood with his hand .
said a voice , as Graham stumbled against a cable .
`` He is the organiser -- the organiser of the revolt .
Faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there , eyes met his and passed and vanished .
Men gesticulated to him , shouted inaudible personal things .
Most of the faces were flushed , but many were ghastly white .
And disease was there , and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean .
As the broad stream passed before him to the right , tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people ; tramp , tramp , tramp , tramp .
Tramp , tramp , tramp , tramp ; his brain was tramping .
Suddenly we struck everywhere .
We got the pull of the aeroplanes . ''
`` Then let us go on , '' said Graham , `` for I want to know more of this . ''
`` They would rob you of your property .
They would do away with property and give the world over to mob rule .
But there will be no Commune here .
There is no need for black police here .
They came leaping down from the gap into the light gallery that had led to the Silent Rooms .
`` They can't come down , '' panted Ostrog .
It 's all right .
The man in yellow was close to him , with a set face and shining eyes .
Throb , throb , throb -- pause -- throb , throb -- he set his teeth , his face into an involuntary grimace , and crash !
Then he went on :
Mr. Stanley pointed to the letter with a pipe he had drawn from his jacket pocket .
They were the only real marriages she had seen clearly .
She evolved a dim image of herself cooped up in a house under the benevolent shadow of Mr. Manning .
She awoke out of a doze , as though she had never been sleeping .
and decided that this was not so , and would not look to right or left again .
She spent the evening in writing -- it was a little difficult -- to her father and -- which was easier -- to the Widgetts .
The necessity of defending herself and assuming a confident and secure tone did much to dispell the sense of being exposed and indefensible in a huge dingy world that abounded in sinister possibilities .
Afterward she wanted to get her letter to her father back in order to read it over again , and , if it tallied with her general impression of it , re-write it .
She meant to live her own life , and he meant , with contempt and insults , to prevent her .
Anything else that was said she now regarded only as an aspect of or diversion from that .
`` She does n't know . ''
She made a curious movement toward her niece , then suddenly , convulsively , she dabbed down something lumpy on the table and turned to follow her brother .
Ann Veronica stared for a moment in amazement at this dark-green object that clashed as it was put down .
It was a purse .
She made a step forward .
`` And besides , when it comes to the idea of queens , '' Ann Veronica went on , `` there 's twenty-one and a half million women to twenty million men .
Still , that leaves over a million shrines short , not reckoning widows who re-marry .
`` He 's a Fellow of the Royal Society , and he ca n't be much over thirty , '' said Miss Klegg .
Her greatest exploit was the howling before the mid-day meal .
To many in that crowded solitude it came as an extraordinary relief .
You 've got to adjust yourself to the people God has set about you .
But I do n't care ; I have n't a spark of shame .
`` We 'll clean up everything tidy , '' said Capes ... .
`` A girl can always keep a man at a distance if she cares to do it .
She -- She can snub him . ''
And really , when one has an idea -- a novel , fertilising idea -- I do n't want to be uncharitable , but -- ''
`` My dear sir , '' I cried , `` do n't you see you 've done thousands of pounds' worth of damage ? ''
`` Why have we no chairs ? ''
There came a little jerk , a noise like champagne being uncorked in another room , and a faint whistling sound .
He spoke with a sudden lack of assurance .
And while these sounds were still about us we came to the edge of a great open space , perhaps two hundred yards in diameter , and perfectly level .
Save for a few lichens that advanced from its margin this space was bare , and presented a powdery surface of a dusty yellow colour .
`` What can it be ? ''
I asked ; `` what can it be ? ''
`` It 's dark enough . ''
Then I perceived his head and shoulders dimly outlined against a fainter darkness .
Cavor noted this difference as soon , or sooner , than I did , and I think , too , that it filled him with much the same wild hope .
`` We might attempt once more to establish some sort of understanding with the minds of the people in the moon . ''
We stood up side by side .
I stood with Cavor 's cap in my hand , staring at the trampled reeds and thorns about me .
A dozen yards away , perhaps , the rising breeze dragged something into view , something small and vividly white .
I knew instantly that I must be in England .
I dare say I looked a ferocious savage enough -- dirty , unkempt , to an indescribable degree ; but it did not occur to me at the time .
I answered Mr. Wendigee jestingly , but he replied in a manner that put such suspicion altogether aside , and in a state of inconceivable excitement I hurried from Algiers to the little observatory upon the Monte Rosa in which he was working .
In the presence of his record and his appliances -- and above all of the messages from Cavor that were coming to hand -- my lingering doubts vanished .
I decided at once to accept a proposal he made to me to remain with him , assisting him to take down the record from day to day , and endeavouring with him to send a message back to the moon .
`` After the pause came the salutation .
The encyclopaedic galaxy of the learned that had accompanied me to the entrance of the last hall appeared two steps above me and left and right of me , in readiness for the Grand Lunar 's need , and Phi-oo 's pale brain placed itself about half-way up to the throne in such a position as to communicate easily between us without turning his back on either the Grand Lunar or myself .
There came a pause .
The eyes of the nearer court went from me to the Grand Lunar and came back to me , and a hissing and piping of expectation passed across the hidden multitudes below and ceased .
`` There came a pause , the cooling sprays impinged upon his brow , and then he spoke again . ''
Body is repudiated as a garment , position is an accident , the past that made us exists not since it is past , the future exists not for we shall never see it ; at last nothing but the abstracted ego remains , -- a sort of complimentary Nirvana .
Let this be the rule for your devotions . ''
Rather a virtuous man than any resultant whatever from his lifetime , for the future of the world .
And just as kingship is a secondary and debatable thing to the New Republican , to every man , that is , whom the spirit of the new knowledge has taken for its work , so also are the loyalties of nationality , and all our local and party adhesions .
I believe that long before humanity has hammered out the question of what is pre-eminently desirable in inheritance , a certain number of things will have been isolated and defined as pre-eminently undesirable .
Why then should we not apply the Jury system to the electoral riddle ?
The text-book , however good , and the lecturer , however able , are only one of two necessary factors in College work , the reciprocal element is the students ' activity .
Examinations , examinations by teachers who understand this very fine art , in which the student is obliged to restate , apply , and use the principles of his subject , are of the utmost value in keeping the mind active and not simply receptive .
And then there might be discussions -- if the Professor were clever enough to conduct them .
`` What news from the common ? ''
At that I gripped my wife 's arm , and without ceremony ran her out into the road .
He turned , stared , bawled something about `` crawling out in a thing like a dish cover , '' and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest .
A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment .
In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise , and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking .
The horse lay motionless ( his neck was broken , poor brute ! )
I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves .
After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet , and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet .
I gave a cry of astonishment .
I saw and thought nothing of the other four Martian monsters ; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident .
It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns .
To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the same effect -- the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night , lit only as it was by the slender moon , the stars , the afterglow of the daylight , and the ruddy glare from St. George 's Hill and the woods of Painshill .
We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark -- for we dared not strike a light -- and ate bread and ham , and drank beer out of the same bottle .
The curate , who was still timorous and restless , was now , oddly enough , for pushing on , and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us .
And strangest of all is it to hold my wife 's hand again , and to think that I have counted her , and that she has counted me , among the dead .
Repeating these facts in other words , the rabbit takes into its body complex and unstable organic compounds containing nitrogen , carbon , hydrogen , a certain amount of oxygen , a small quantity of sulphur , and still smaller amounts of other elements .
It also breathes in oxygen .
This chapter directs the student 's attention to the most important points in the study of the skeleton , but it is in no way intended to mitigate the necessity of practical work .
The stylohyal ( s.h . )

In the male it usually disappears ; the uterus masculinus of the rabbit is still very generally regarded as a vestige of it .
Kolliker has shown , however , that this interpretation is improbable .
Ms. is the mesonephros , some or all of which becomes the epididymis in the male of types possessing that organ , and is connected with G. by the vasa efferentia .
-Chordata_ ( = Vertebrata , as used by Lankester ) .
At the end of segmentation we get a hollow sphere of small cells , the cells separating from one another centrally and enclosing a cavity as the process proceeds .
In this process a portion of the blastosphere wall is the tucked into the rest , as indicated by the arrow , so that a two-layered sack is formed .
The young amphioxus has , at this stage , which is called the gastrula stage , a curious parallelism with such a lowly form as the Hydra of our ditches .
This latter creature , like the gastrula , consists essentially of two layers of cells , an outer protective and sensory layer , and an inner digestive one ; it has a primordial intestine , or archenteron , and its mouth is sometimes regarded as being a blastopore .
The position of this mouth is at the velum .
The formation of the atrium has been described .

Describe , with diagrams , the nervous system of amphioxus , and compare its nervous axis , in detail , with that of a vertebrate .
Now the parent or parents , since they live and breed , must be more or less , but sufficiently , adapted to their conditions of living -- more or less fitted to the needs of life .
The variation in the young animal will be one of three kinds : it will fit the animal still better to the conditions under which its kind live , or it will be a change for the worse , or it is possible to imagine that the variation -- as in the colour variations of domesticated cats -- will affect its prospects in life very little .
Hence , disregarding accidents , which may be eliminated from the problem by taking many cases , there is a continual tendency among the members of a species of animals in favour of the proportionate increase of the individuals most completely adapted to the conditions under which the species lives .

`` I think you had better win an empire , Mr .
`` So modest and unassuming , '' sang Mrs. Pope .
I suppose he 's almost the greatest humorist we have .

`` Very little , '' said Mr .
`` Very little -- ''
This morning something of the awfulness of her position came to her ... .
The thought of a young life , new , untarnished , just at the outset , just addressing itself to the task of getting on , always stimulated her mind extremely , and she talked to Marjorie with a very real and effectual desire to help her to the utmost of her ability .
`` My dear child !
`` Not a bit of it .
A third effort gave `` Wathall about , eh ? ''
I want to clear my character .
As though it is foolish to follow a vortex ring into a vacuum , and wise to whack at a dirty golf ball on a suburban railway bank .
You might have thought there had been a Resurrection or somethin ' , and cleared off everybody .
`` Do n't they ? ''
She struck my memory -- her work stood out . ''
`` You ought to have had all boys , '' said Mrs. Pope .
So it had come to this -- and she had not seen it coming .
He vanished with incredible velocity .
His expression of surprise changed to malevolence , and he darted back into the room from which he had emerged .
Trafford decided to take the advice of a small brass plate on his left hand , and `` ring also . ''
He returned about seven in a state of nervous apprehension ; came upstairs two steps at a time , and stopped breathless on the landing .
Then he would n't talk such nonsense about our Work . ''
One day at the Carmels ' she found herself engaged in a vigorous flirtation with young Carmel .
He said he was writing a play , a wonderful passionate play about St. Francis , and only she could inspire and advise him .
On her way home she was acutely ashamed of herself ; this was the first time she had let any man but Trafford think he might be interesting to her , but once or twice on former occasions she had been on the verge of such provocative intimations .
`` I do n't understand , '' she began .
`` What has he done ? ''
She went on to the apprehension of a change in him that hitherto she had not permitted herself to see -- a change in his attitude to her .
There had been a time when she had seemed able without an effort to nestle inside his heart .
Was it fair that she should come back into the sheath because of this passion of his for a vast inexhaustible research ?
Dowd became at last entirely representative .
`` It 's just the good , the exquisite things in life , that make me rebel against this life we are leading .
It is impossible , dear , it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for us -- just for these vulgarities . ''
`` Wo n't make much difference , '' said Trafford , and opened his eyes .
`` This flame that arises out of life , that redeems life from purposeless triviality , _isn't_ life .
That 's a very important point . ''
`` I want my life over again , and to go back .
`` We 've got to come , '' said Marjorie .
He was rather disappointed that they did not join in with him .
In the evening , after they had supped , he discussed religion , being curious by this time about their beliefs and procedure .
And there was commerce ; the shops and markets and store-rooms full of nasturtium seed , thrift seed , lupin beans and suchlike provender from the garden ; such stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-boxes , or packed in sacks of old glove fingers tied up with thread and sent off by waggons along the great military road to the beleaguered fortress on the Indian frontier beyond the worn places that were dismal swamps .
This particular afternoon is no doubt mixed up in my memory with many other afternoons ; all sorts of things my father said and did at different times have got themselves referred to it ; it filled me at the time with a great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has become the symbol now for all our intercourse together .
If I did n't understand the things he said , I did the mood he was in .
They made me leave them at the corner of a road of small houses near Penge Station .
I mean to know what I 'm doing . ''
asked Benton , voicing the thought that had arrested our flow .
`` We have got to think out , '' he said , `` just what we are and what we are up to .
We 've got to do that now .
The curate said there was socialism AND socialism , and looked at Margaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance .
But she was all , he perceived , for broad-mindness , and he stirred himself ( and incidentally his tea ) to still more liberality of expression .
He said the state of the poor was appalling , simply appalling ; that there were times when he wanted to shatter the whole system , `` only , '' he said , turning to me appealingly , `` What have we got to put in its place ? ''
`` But what is one to do ? ''
There seems to be nothing going forward , no ideas , no dreams .
It was n't clear at first how we differed .
I could n't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora did .
I have told how flittingly and uninvited it came like a moth from the outer twilight into my life , how it grew in me with my manhood , how it found its way to speech and grew daring , and led me at last to experience .
I wonder if it was .
By a happy chance Parvill caught my eye .
I distinctly recall the rebound of my mind .
`` By God ! ''
I am here to do something , and do something I will ! ''
How far -- and this was more vital -- are they rendering lip-service to social organisations ?
I thought at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task .
Who would n't have been ?
He leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm .
She had not got her handkerchief out for fear that I should see this , but I saw her tears , dark drops of tears , upon her sleeve ... .
He had dodged it and got away ; at the time it had seemed an immense feat to White and the others who were safely up the field .
He had walked to the fence , risking a second charge by his deliberation .
He had said this with white intensity , he had stopped abruptly in mid-sentence , and then suddenly he had dropped to the ground , clutched the fence , struggled with heaving shoulders , and been sick .
A warm , faintly-scented breeze just stirred the dead grass and the leaves .
In the day the air had been still .
The engagement thus opened was renewed with great energy at lunch .
`` And what good are all these proposals ?
If you divided all the property up between everybody , you 'd have rich and poor again in a year . ''
`` Some of it is missing . ''
By some rapid mental alchemy these fingers had now become Home Rule and Tariff Reform .
His right hand which had hitherto taken no part in the controversy , had raised its index finger by imperceptible degrees .
It had been raised almost subconsciously .
Early ice coming down the Atlantic perhaps .
It was wonderful to be here on the top of the round world and feel the icebergs away there .
Anyhow it was an extremely cold wind .
Benham looked for a moment like his father .
`` But I want to start round the world , '' he cried with a note of acute distress .
`` I want to go to Egypt and India and see what is happening in the East , all this wonderful waking up of the East , I know nothing of the way the world is going -- ... ''
They had been so delightful to him that he felt quite acutely the slight he was putting upon them by this delay .
Lady Marayne 's moods , however , had been so uncertain that he had found no occasion to broach this trifling matter , and when at last the occasion came he perceived in the same instant the fullest reasons for regretting it .
`` There are ways of finding out , '' she insisted .
She stopped short , and Benham nodded for her to go on .
Those Downs there -- look at them !
And while you are travelling I shall think of you -- and think of you ... . ''
It was part of the fascination of Amanda that she was never what he had supposed her to be , and that nothing that he set out to do with her ever turned out as they had planned it .
They spent a long day on the ice of the Aletsch glacier , but they reached the inn on its eastward side with magnificent appetites a little late for dinner .
For drink there was coffee and raw spirits .
`` Here we are , '' he said , `` not a week from London , and you see the sort of life that men live when the forces of civilization fail .
This country frets me .
I ca n't see any fun in it , ca n't see the humour of it .
And the people away there know no better than to play off tribe against tribe , sect against sect , one peasant prejudice against another .
We shall come to where the Servian plots against the Bulgarian and the Greek against both , and the Turk , with spasmodic massacres and indulgences , broods over the brew .
And there is no one , no one , with the sense to over-ride all these squalid hostilities .
All those fools away there in London and Vienna and St. Petersburg and Rome take sides as though these beastly tribes and leagues and superstitions meant anything but blank , black , damnable ignorance .
There is n't a religion in the whole Balkan peninsula , there isn't a tribal or national sentiment that deserves a moment 's respect from a sane man .
They 're things like niggers ' nose-rings and Chinese secret societies ; childish things , idiot things that have to go .
And I shall come back . ''
`` I told her all about Anna ! ''
'Dancing attendance ' -- as they used to say .
Such is the inelegance of the jealous state .
`` What maddens me , '' he said , `` is the democracy of the whole thing .
I HATE this modern democracy .
What does all this struggle here amount to ?
`` Stop this folly ! ''
Oh , my ! ''
I took a line of intelligent interest , tinged with a reasonable doubt of the whole story .
In that endeavour I had a social advantage .
Skelmersdale , like too many of his class , is something of a snob ; he had told me to `` shut it , '' only under sudden , excessive provocation , and with , I am certain , a subsequent repentance ; he was , I knew , quite glad to be seen walking about the village with me .
`` It was like that with me , '' he said , `` over there at Aldington .
First I did n't care a bit and it was all her , and afterwards , when it was too late , it was , in a manner of speaking , all me . ''
`` 'You CA N'T ? '
`` All the same , I 'd rather he did n't , '' said Wish .
`` What else could I do , man ?
I made 'em rig me up a sort of holy of holies , and a deuce of a time I had too , making them understand what it was I wanted them to do .
Sometimes they did the things I wanted all right , and sometimes they did them all wrong .
They was always very willing , certainly .
All the while I was puzzling how I was to get the confounded business settled .
`` That 's a question for the seconds , '' said Gibberne .
I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened -- I suppose because there were two of us .
Every now and then vague shapes like drifting wreaths of smoke made the vision a little indistinct , but at first I paid little heed to them .
It was like watching the affairs of a glass hive . ''
`` You ca n't be TOO careful WHO you marry , '' said Mr. Brisher , and pulled thoughtfully with a fat-wristed hand at the lank moustache that hides his want of chin .
I made a sympathetic noise .
Miss Winchelsea would not give him any answer when at last , in the Borghese , she could have a minute with him ; but she promised him a note .
For a few seconds they stared at her stare , and then her expression changed back to a more familiar one .
she asked in an even tone .
`` No , '' I answered ; `` you 've been dreaming .
I told him again very patiently and clearly : 'You must not come here .
These are old temples and I am here with my dead . '
Such thought was interwoven with the very fabric of that pioneer school in the educational renascence in England .
The insanitary horse and the plebeian bicycle had been banished from the roadway , which was now of a resilient , glass-like surface , spotlessly clean ; and the foot passenger was restricted to a narrow vestige of the ancient footpath on either side of the track and forbidden at the risk of a fine , if he survived , to cross the roadway .
People descended from their automobiles upon this pavement and went through the lower shops to the lifts and stairs to the new ways for pedestrians , the Rows , that ran along the front of the houses at the level of the first story , and , being joined by frequent bridges , gave the newer parts of London a curiously Venetian appearance .
For most of the day and all night the shop windows were lit by electric light , and many establishments had made , as it were , canals of public footpaths through their premises in order to increase their window space .
'I was n't angry , ' said Barnet .
Of course the rich were vulgar and the poor grew savage and every added power that came to men made the rich richer and the poor less necessary and less free .
Then close to her , rising above a confusion of debris , she recognised the Trocadero ; it was changed , something had gone from it , but its outline was unmistakable .
On the mountain-side above the town of Brissago and commanding two long stretches of Lake Maggiore , looking eastward to Bellinzona , and southward to Luino , there is a shelf of grass meadows which is very beautiful in springtime with a great multitude of wild flowers .
To the westward of this delightful shelf there is a deep and densely wooded trench , a great gulf of blue some mile or so in width out of which arise great precipices very high and wild .
Here , brought together by the indefatigable energy of that impassioned humanitarian , Leblanc , the French ambassador at Washington , the chief Powers of the world were to meet in a last desperate conference to 'save humanity . '
For the whole world was flaring then into a monstrous phase of destruction .
They went to war in a delirium of panic , in order to use their bombs first .
It must have seemed plain at last to every one in those days that the world was slipping headlong to anarchy .
Most of the capital cities of the world were burning ; millions of people had already perished , and over great areas government was at an end .
Humanity has been compared by one contemporary writer to a sleeper who handles matches in his sleep and wakes to find himself in flames .
'Three bombs , ' they answered together .
Pestovitch went and came , instructing trusty servants , planning and replanning ... .
Would not Monsieur be wiser to seek a house ? '
And as we come up to the time of the Last Wars , this newer conception of the everyday life as a reaction to an accelerated development is continually more manifest .
Barnet 's book , which has served us so well , is frankly a picture of the world coming about like a ship that sails into the wind .
They tell of the universal struggle of jealousy to capture and cripple our souls , of romantic failures and tragical misconceptions of the trend of the world , of the spirit of adventure , and the urgency of curiosity , and how these serve the universal drift .
The clearer their vision and the subtler their art , the more certainly do these novels tell of the possibility of salvation for all the world .
'It is you poets , Kahn , with your love songs which turn the sweet fellowship of comrades into this woman-centred excitement .
They become the subjects of their own artistry .
And even when they seem to react against that , they may do it still .
I have been reading in the old papers of the movements to emancipate women that were going on before the discovery of atomic force .
Helen of Holloway was at last as big a nuisance in her way as Helen of Troy , and so long as you think of yourselves as women ' -- he held out a finger at Rachel and smiled gently -- 'instead of thinking of yourselves as intelligent beings , you will be in danger of -- Helenism .
To think of yourselves as women is to think of yourselves in relation to men .
Fowler told them of the mass of inquiry accumulated and arranged by the genius of Tchen , who was beginning to define clearly the laws of inheritance and how the sex of children and the complexions and many of the parental qualities could be determined .
I was ill in bed , reading Samuel Warren 's `` Ten Thousand a Year , '' and noting how much the world can change in seventy years .
To emerge with the sum of 4s .
as a minimum , by calculating on the basis of the mine 's present earnings , from a conference which the miners and everybody else imagined was to give a minimum of 5s.
, may be clever , but it is certainly not politic in the present stage of Labour feeling .
That is not , of course , inevitable , but I am taking now the more hopeful view .
There is another , and that is the great desirability of every class in the community having a practical knowledge of what labour means .
There is a vast amount of work which either is now or is likely to be in the future within the domain of the public administration -- road-making , mining , railway work , post-office and telephone work , medical work , nursing , a considerable amount of building for example .
Why should we employ people to do the bulk of these things at all ?
I believe this would be of enormous moral benefit to our strained and relaxed community .
I believe that in making labour a part of everyone's life and the whole of nobody 's life lies the ultimate solution of these industrial difficulties .
The two things , I admit , pass by insensible gradations into one another , but while on the one hand such work as being a master gardener and growing roses , or a master cabinet maker and making fine pieces , or an artist of almost any sort , or a story writer , or a consulting physician , or a scientific investigator , or a keeper of wild animals , or a forester , or a librarian , or a good printer , or many sorts of engineer , is work that will always find men of a certain temperament enthusiastically glad to do it , if they can only do it for comfortable pay -- for such work is in itself _living_ -- there is , on the other hand , work so irksome and toilsome , such as coal mining , or being a private soldier during a peace , or attending upon lunatics , or stoking , or doing over and over again , almost mechanically , little bits of a modern industrial process , or being a cash desk clerk in a busy shop , that few people would undertake if they could avoid it .
With this there is also associated the grazing or herding over wider or more restricted areas , belonging either collectively or discretely to the community , of sheep , cattle , goats , or swine , and almost always the domestic fowl is commensal with man in this life .
We may take as the extremest opposite to the eternal marriage idea the proposal of Mr. Bernard Shaw , that marriage should be terminable at the instance of either party .
You might marry a dozen times in that way in a day ... .
Somewhere between these extremes lies the marriage law of a civilised state .
Let us , rather than working down from the eternal marriage of the religious idealists , work up from Mr. Shaw .
Gramophones thinly disguised as bishops , gramophones still more thinly disguised as eminent statesmen , gramophones K.C.B .
We all know the profound droop of the eminent person 's eyelids as he produces that discovery , the edifying deductions or the solemn warnings he unfolds from this proposition , and all the dignified , inconclusive rigmarole of that cylinder .
It must be repeated that the American tradition is really the tradition of one particular ingredient in this great admixture and stirring up of peoples .
This ingredient is the Colonial British , whose seventeenth century Puritanism and eighteenth century mercantile radicalism and rationalism manifestly furnished all the stuff out of which the American tradition is made .
It is this stuff planted in virgin soil and inflated to an immense and buoyant optimism by colossal and unanticipated material prosperity and success .
Its preparation eats more and more into the resources which should be furnishing a developing civilisation ; its possibilities of destruction are incalculable .
A new epoch has opened with the coming of the navigable balloon and the flying machine .
Imagine such monsters of the air , and wild financial panic below !
The vicarage people certainly hold a place by themselves in the typical English scheme ; nothing is more remarkable than the progress the Church has made -- socially -- in the last two hundred years .
When I meet the large assumptions of the contemporary cleric , I am apt to think of these things .
the village shopkeeper 's eldest son , the first footman , younger sons of the village shopkeeper , his first assistant , and so forth .
`` George , '' said my mother , `` do n't kick the chair ! ''
how much they did for us !
All streams came from the then undiscovered `` sources of the Nile '' in those days , all thickets were Indian jungles , and our best game , I say it with pride , I invented .
So we have burst at times , weeping and rejoicing , upon startled wayfarers .
Altogether my school might easily have been worse for me , and among other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out .
`` No , 'e does n't , '' said I , in the heat of the moment .
You start in to get a hundred percent .
It means , in a way , a reproof for Pride .
You calculate you're going to do this or that , but at bottom who knows at all WHAT he's doing ?
When you most think you 're doing things , they 're being done right over your head .
You 're being Led . ''
What was going to become of me ?
Then she would say , `` No !
We made Tono-Bungay hum !
All that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement ; Tono-Bungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of scientific research , no passionate service of humanity could ever have given me ... .
It was my uncle 's genius that did it .
He might very possibly bottle things , but would he stick a label round 'em and sell 'em ?
They prevent things getting at him .
And it 's not your poetry only .
Health , Strength and Beauty -- in a bottle -- the magic philtre !
Like a fairy tale ... .
It seems the next thing to childhood now .
We were both in certain directions unusually ignorant and simple ; we were temperamentally antagonistic , and we had n't -- I do n't think we were capable of -- an idea in common .
Out of the profits on the Persian robes she supported a sister 's family of three children , she `` helped '' a worthless brother , and overflowed in help even to her workgirls , but that did n't weigh with me in those youthfully-narrow times .
Before all things I coveted her grip upon Marion 's inaccessible mind .
She paused for a moment .
I was going to and fro about Tono-Bungay -- the business I had taken up to secure Marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separation -- and snatching odd week-ends and nights for Orpington , and all the while I struggled with these obstinate interrogations .
I have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward Seven Oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country , and that I was thinking out my destiny .
I could almost write my thought down now , I believe , as they came to me that afternoon .
I perceived I could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again , that stagnant disappointment .
At times they became a sort of fairy-story with us , an imaginative exercise .
But to Thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me , and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap .
We found that Gordon-Nasmyth , still unaware of the altered value of the stuff , and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium , had got hold of a cousin named Pollack , made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy , and was buying a brig .
We put in , put down three thousand pounds , and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the Pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air , leaving Pollack , I regret to say , in the brig and in the secret -- except so far as canadium and the filament went -- as residuum .
We discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig , but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all , to put it plainly , stealing .
`` We 've come to French , '' said my aunt , `` anyhow . ''
I soothed her as well as I could .
The first trial was bound to be the worst ; it was an experiment I made with life , and the chance of death or injury was , I supposed , about equal to the chance of success .
It might turn over .
I might upset it .
It might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me .
The conditions of the flight necessitated alert attention ; it was n't a thing to be done by jumping off and shutting one 's eyes or getting angry or drunk to do it .
For ten seconds or so , as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and with the wind in my eyes , the rush of the ground beneath me filled me with sick and helpless terror ; I felt as though some violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone , and I groaned aloud .
Are you better ? ''
She took my arm and turned me down the lane .
One never knows in these old families ... .
The captain came and talked .
`` Seen the papers ? ''
`` My stomack is n't what it was , '' he explained .
`` One finds it -- these times .
Your Marconigram -- it took me in the wind a bit . ''
Should I perhaps presently happen upon her ?
Then he made a gesture that he wished to speak .
That 's why I'm talking .
We 've always loved one another , and never said anything about it , and you understand , and I understand .
But my heart 's torn to pieces by this , torn to rags , and things drop out I 've kept in it .
But he was my child , George , he was my child and all my children , my silly child , and life has knocked him about for me , and I 've never had a say in the matter ; never a say ; it 's puffed him up and smashed him -- like an old bag -- under my eyes .
If WE could see the lightness of it --
We started in the late afternoon .
We cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the Parliament houses , and the flag was flying and Parliament was sitting .
Will this diversion of the vast omnibus traffic of to-day into the air and underground , together with the segregation of van traffic to specific routes and times , be the only change in the streets of the new century ?
So far as we can judge without a close and uncongenial scrutiny of statistics , that daily journey , that has governed and still to a very considerable extent governs the growth of cities , has had , and probably always will have , a maximum limit of two hours , one hour each way from sleeping place to council chamber , counter , workroom , or office stool .
And taking this assumption as sound , we can state precisely the maximum area of various types of town .
A pedestrian agglomeration such as we find in China , and such as most of the European towns probably were before the nineteenth century , would be swept entirely by a radius of four miles about the business quarter and industrial centre ; and , under these circumstances , where the area of the feeding regions has been very large the massing of human beings has probably reached its extreme limit .
[ 16 ] Of course , in the case of a navigable river , for example , the commercial centre might be elongated into a line and the circle of the city modified into an ellipse with a long diameter considerably exceeding eight miles , as , for example , in the case of Hankow .
And then there came suddenly the railway and the steamship , the former opening with extraordinary abruptness a series of vast through-routes for trade , the latter enormously increasing the security and economy of the traffic on the old water routes .
Well has Mr. George Gissing named nineteenth-century London in one of his great novels the `` Whirlpool , '' the very figure for the nineteenth-century Great City , attractive , tumultuous , and spinning down to death .
Neglecting a few exceptional older corporations which , indeed , in their essence are not usurious , but of unlimited liability , the shareholding body appeared first , in its present character , in the seventeenth century , and came to its full development in the mid-nineteenth .
Was its appearance then due only to the attainment of a certain necessary degree of public credit , or was it correlated with any other force ?
It seems in accordance with facts to relate it to another force , the development of mechanism , so far as certain representative aspects go .
The dividend of the shareholder was the tribute the new enterprise had to pay the old wealth .
And essentially the shareholder represents and will continue to represent the responsible managing owner of a former state of affairs in process of supersession .
The booming of Dickens , too , forced him even into the reluctant hands of Omar 's Fitzgerald .
Instead of `` everyone '' talking of the Great New Book , quite considerable numbers are shamelessly admitting they don't read that sort of thing .
It will almost certainly be the greatest urban region in all the world except that which will arise in the eastern States of North America , and that which may arise somewhere about Hankow .
It will stretch from Lille to Kiel , it will drive extensions along the Rhine valley into Switzerland , and fling an arm along the Moldau to Prague , it will be the industrial capital of the old world .
Even when the coal-field industries of the plain give place to the industrial application of mountain-born electricity , this great city region will remain , I believe , in its present position at the seaport end of the great plain of the Old World .
Considerations of transit will keep it where it has grown , and electricity will be brought to it in mighty cables from the torrents of the central European mountain mass .
I do not see how this great region is to unify itself without some linguistic compromise -- the Germanization of the French-speaking peoples by force is too ridiculous a suggestion to entertain .
It is manifest that a reconstructed ethical system , reconstructed in the light of modern science and to meet the needs of such temperaments and characters as the evolution of mechanism will draw together and develop , will give very different values from those given by the existing systems ( if they can be called systems ) to almost all the great matters of conduct .
All life is the effort of the thing born , driven by fears , guided by instincts and desires , to evade death , to evade even the partial death of crippling or cramping or restriction , and to attain to effective procreation , to the victory of another birth .
In the new vision death is no inexplicable horror , no pointless terminal terror to the miseries of life , it is the end of all the pain of life , the end of the bitterness of failure , the merciful obliteration of weak and silly and pointless things ... .
`` I believe it 's out , '' she said .
The other man in brown made movements indicating commiserating curiosity concerning the alleged fly .
Mr. Hoopdriver -- the word is his own -- stood flabber-gastered .
He had all the intuition of the simple-minded .
But the ground was suddenly cut from his feet .
He felt he had made a fool of himself again .
It was only late in the long evening that , quite abruptly , he began to repent , vividly and decidedly , having fled these two people .
The man was a sinister brute , Hoopdriver saw in a flash of inspiration , and the girl -- she was in some serious trouble .
This new view of it depressed him dreadfully .
Mr. Hoopdriver 's dramatic instincts were now fully awake .
She continued to stare out of the window .
He made a step towards her .
`` I HAVE you , '' , he said .
`` You are mine .
Do you hear -- POWER ! ''
`` Gone , sir .
`` We 've had supper , thenks , and we 're tired , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver .
`` I suppose you wo n't take anything , -- Jessie ? ''
`` It is , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver .
`` I believe you would , '' said Mr. Hoopdriver , admiring her .
`` South Africa IS right ? ''
`` Meanin ' ? ''
She came forward and shook hands with him , looking the while curiously into his face .
And he submitted meekly to a restoration of his self-respect .
`` Is this the man ? ''
said Widgery very grimly , and producing a special voice for the occasion from somewhere deep in his neck .
`` A gelatine lozenge dropped into the tea cup precipitates the tannin in the form of tannate of gelatine , '' said the clergyman to Miss Mergle , in a confidential bray .
`` So far as the Samurai have a purpose in common in maintaining the State and the order and discipline of the world , so far , by their discipline and denial , by their public work and effort , they worship God together .
They may study maps before to guide them , showing any difficulties and dangers in the journey , but they may not carry such helps .
Here is a system of motives and passions , imperious and powerful , which follows no broad general rule and in which each man must needs be a light unto himself upon innumerable issues .
I am satisfied that these personal urgencies are neither to be suppressed nor crudely nor ruthlessly subordinated to the general issues .
Religious and moral teachers are apt to make this part of life either too detached or too insignificant .
Few of us can even worship alone .
True love I think is not simply felt but known .
Just as Salvation as I conceive it demands a fine intelligence and mental activity , so love calls to brain and body alike and all one 's powers .
These , it seems to me , are the boundary and the living capital of the empire of life we rule .
So in the end it may be you or I will find we have been anvil and not hammer in the Purpose of God .
Moreover Minton , the pessimist , reached the end of his appointed time and left -- to enlist in a cavalry regiment and go about this planet leading an insubordinate but interesting life , that ended at last in an intimate , vivid and really you know by no means painful or tragic night grapple in the Terah Valley .
But one was ( most dishonestly ) too big to cuff in spite of his greener years .
The rest of his sentimental interests vanished altogether in this great illumination .
He meditated about her when he was blocking cretonne ; her image was before his eyes at tea-time , and blotted out the more immediate faces , and made him silent and preoccupied , and so careless in his bearing that the junior apprentice , sitting beside him , mocked at and parodied his enormous bites of bread and butter unreproved .
He became conspicuously less popular on the `` fancy '' side , the `` costumes '' was chilly with him and the `` millinery '' cutting .
But he did not care .
An intermittent correspondent with Flo Bates , that had gone on since she left Mr. Shalford 's desk for a position at Tunbridge `` nearer home , '' and which had roused Kipps in its earlier stages to unparalleled heights of epistolatory effort , died out altogether by reason of his neglect .
He glanced round and made a sudden movement almost as if to mount his machine .
`` One ca n't _always_ be living like a curit , '' he said .
`` It is n't the name any decent people would give to a girl , '' said Buggins , `` -- -- common or not . ''
`` Goonight , o ' man , '' said Buggins , with convincing earnestness .
`` _Whad_ do you say ? ''
`` One of our chaps just been left sixty thousand pounds , '' said the first apprentice , returning after a great absence , to his customer .
`` I dessay that young Quodling was in it , '' said Mrs. Kipps .
He was awakened by a thrush singing in the fresh dawn .
Twelve 'undred a year !
Coote hesitated and declined , and then , with great liberality , `` Do n't let me hinder you ... . ''
Kipps was never a good liar .
A 'eadache perhaps -- three or four times , say .
But there it is ! ''
There were several things by the post , tradesmen 's circulars and cards and two pathetic begging letters -- his luck had got into the papers -- and there was a letter from a literary man and a book to enforce his request for 10/ -- to put down Socialism .
Kipps dipped in it and was seriously perturbed .
There was a bust of Beethoven over the bookcase and the walls were thick with conscientiously executed but carelessly selected `` views '' in oil and water colours and gilt frames .
She wore her hair in a knob behind , and the sight of the knob suggested to Kipps an explanation for a frequent gesture of Coote 's , a patting exploratory movement to the back of his head .
Instead , they remained in Folkestone , and this happy chance gave Kipps just all these opportunities of which he stood in need .
She diverged to talk of flowers , and Kipps ' mind was filled with the picture of Helen bending down towards him in the Keep ... .
So Kipps embarked upon his engagement , steeled himself to the high enterprise of marrying above his breeding .
The transaction was unexpectedly easy , and within the hour Kipps , spectacled and wrapped about , was tootling through Dymchurch .
It had been conceded they were to be provided for comfortably , and the phrase `` retire from business '' had been very much in the air .
It was an agreeable dream , but when it came to the point of deciding upon this particular cottage or that , and on this particular house or that , Kipps was surprised by an unexpected clinging to the little home , which he had always understood to be the worst of all possible houses .
he reflected , `` Art Kipps !
I wonder what you _could_ do .
He 'd tell you things .
Or a new Socialist paper .
`` You stick to this , my boy , '' he said .
`` You get it repaired by someone who knows .
It 's the most vallyble thing I got you so far , you take my word . ''
He 'as n't 'ad any on the stage yet .
As he was getting into bed that night he remembered something for the first time !
All sorts of dreams and impressions that had gone clean out of his mental existence came back to him , changed and brought up to date to fit her altered presence .
He thought of how he had gone back to New Romney for his Christmas holidays , determined to kiss her , and of the awful blankness of the discovery that she had gone away .
He got up late , cut his chin while shaving , kicked a slipper into his sponge bath and said , `` Desh ! ''
The room was large and quiet at first , and he sat back restfully until it occurred to him that his attitude brought his extremely dusty boots too prominently into the light , so instead he sat up , and then people of the upper and upper middle classes began to come and group themselves about him and have tea likewise , and so revive the class animosities of the previous day .
They would probably take it out of him by charging pounds and pounds .
`` You 're engaged to that girl .
They stared at one another again .
`` Yes , '' said Kipps , on the hearthrug , `` 'Ot and cold water laid on to each bedroom -- we 've settled on that . ''
`` I _been_ for a walk this morning .
How had it all happened exactly ?
`` There 's Buttud Toce down there !
By your foot ! ''
There was a pause , husband and wife regarded one another .
He thrust out his chin and glared at fate .
He spoke with immense deliberation .
Before him is one of those engraved memorandum forms , a moist pad , wet with some thick and greasy greenish purple ink that is also spreading quietly but steadily over his fingers , a cross-nibbed pen for first-aid surgical assistance to the patient in his hand , a dating rubber stamp .
`` My play , boo-hoo ! ''
( sob ) You know ? ''
I called after him , but the door had closed .
I fell at full length upon the floor , and the door slammed and shut out the passionate intensity of his face .
Then I heard the key turn in the lock , and Montgomery 's voice in expostulation .
THE SAYERS OF THE LAW .
The water was very shallow at first .
I was thirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist .
`` So for twenty years altogether -- counting nine years in England -- I have been going on ; and there is still something in everything I do that defeats me , makes me dissatisfied , challenges me to further effort .
It 's afterwards , as I observe them , that the persuasion fades .
But I will conquer yet !
Each time I dip a living creature into the bath of burning pain , I say , 'This time I will burn out all the animal ; this time I will make a rational creature of my own ! '
After all , what is ten years ?
`` But I am drawing near the fastness .
Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me , and , looking round , sprang to my feet with a cry of horror .
Against the warm dawn great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure , and through their stormy darkness shot flickering threads of blood-red flame .
Then the thatched roof caught .
A spurt of fire jetted from the window of my room .
I was anxious to be alone , to think out the position in which I was now placed .
I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing , but I was still inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress .
I felt that I ought to cross the island and establish myself with the Beast People , and make myself secure in their confidence .
And there I sat , chin on knees , the sun beating down upon my head and unspeakable dread in my mind , plotting how I could live on against the hour of my rescue ( if ever rescue came ) .
I tried to review the whole situation as calmly as I could , but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion .
So they walked in the rose garden .
`` Campanella , '' said Hugh , without betraying the slightest interest in Miss Corner .
`` Nothing changes in England , because the people who want to change things change their minds before they change anything else .
Do n't you think , Sir , there 's something about science -- it 's steadier than anything else in the world ? ''
His legs were not legs to be ashamed of .
He was still weighing the effect of this fillet upon the mind of Miss Corner when Teddy left him to make his own modest preparations .
The general effect was quite satisfactory .
She did not seem to hear that .
Is there somewhere in the immensities some responsive kindliness , some faint hope of toleration and assistance , something sensibly on our side against death and mechanical cruelty ?
If so , it certainly refuses to pamper us ... .
One can not imagine the ruler of everything a devil -- that would be silly .
And manifestly then , the good of life , the significance of any life that is not mere receptivity , lies in the disciplined and clarified will and the sharpened and tempered mind .
And what for the last twenty years -- for all his lectures and writings -- had he been doing to marshal the will and harden the mind which were his weapons against the Dark ?
`` I thought I 'd like to tell you , '' said Mr. Direck and became tremendously silent .
`` Of course Russia will mobilise , '' said Herr Heinrich .
Something but very dimly apprehended at Matching 's Easy , something methodical and compelling away in London , seemed to be fumbling and feeling after Herr Heinrich , and Herr Heinrich it appeared was responding .
`` 'T is a noosence , '' said Hickson , `` but anyhow , they give first prize to his radishes .
She had a knack of exasperating Mr. Britling 's father , a knack which to a less marked degree she also possessed in relation to the son .
But Mr. Britling senior never acquired the art of disregarding her .
Her method -- if one may call the natural expression of a personality a method -- was an invincibly superior knowledge , a firm and ill-concealed belief that all statements made in her hearing were wrong and most of them absurd , and a manner calm , assured , restrained .
She may have been born with the air of thinking the doctor a muff and knowing how to manage all this business better .
He grew up rather to like her -- most people rather liked her -- and to attach a certain importance to her unattainable approval .
`` And send a lot of Zeppelins , '' said the smallest boy .
`` Herr Heinrich told us they can fly thousands of miles . ''
`` Because we may be invaded ! ''
she said , and Mr. Direck 's sense of error deepened .
`` It 's bringing the war home to us ... .
The English because of their insularity had been political amateurs for endless generations .
All their habits inclined them to fight good-temperedly and comfortably , to quarrel with a government and not with a people .
It took Mr. Britling at least a couple of months of warfare to understand that the Germans were fighting in an altogether different spirit .
They contradicted his habitual world .
And then he was alone again staring over a wet black field towards a dim crest of shapeless trees .
`` Not like this .
And it would be swank -- a thing we detest in the army . ''
Teddy 's so grave nowadays .
It 's a mean thing , I know , it has none of the Roman touch , but I am glad that this ca n't happen with Hugh -- '' He computed .
`` Not for a year and three months , even if they march him into it upon his very birthday ... .
He 'll write . ''
He was surprised that Letty had not assailed him with railing accusations .
None had been found alive .
Mr. Direck had been at great pains to hunt up wounded men from Teddy 's company , and also any likely Canadians both at the base hospital in France and in London , and to get what he could from them .
`` He had been prodded in half-a-dozen places .
His head was nearly severed from his body . ''
`` Not a bit of it !
I have been planning all sorts of things ... .
I have been thinking how I could get to Germany ... .
I 've had all sorts of plans .
They ca n't go guarded for ever ... .
Such was the brief story of Herr Heinrich .
The triangle and the eye became almost visible upon the black background of night .
They were spinning round and round faster and faster .
he was weary ... .
That night insomnia resumed its sway .
You must get out of this state , one way or another . ''
Later of course , it will be possible to write a prescription .
Now add the water -- so .
said the bishop in an eager whisper .
The vision of God was far off among his memories now , and difficult to recall .
he said without any sincerity in his polite pleasure .
`` We 've had to go rather short .
He was both there and not there .
The latter was now awakening to the things about him ; the former marked his gestures and listened with an entire detachment to the words he was saying .
These words he was saying to Lady Ella : `` God is coming to rule the world , I tell you .
We must leave the church . ''
`` Oh , Edward ! ''
I have been willing -- you know I have been willing -- for any help .
For the rest of that day until his breakdown in the cathedral the sense of being in two places at the same time haunted the bishop 's mind .
It 's time I returned to Princhester . ''
`` To think that one should be consulted about visions of God -- in Mount Street ! ''
Charles Voysey , Swedenborgians , Moslem converts , Indian Theosophists , psychic phenomena and so forth , to meet him .
Nevertheless it began to drift into his mind that he was by no means so completely in control of the new departure as he had supposed at first .
Both he and Lady Sunderbund professed universalism ; but while his was the universalism of one who would simplify to the bare fundamentals of a common faith , hers was the universalism of the collector .
The first was `` The Countess of Huntingdon and Her Circle , '' that bearder of lightminded archbishops , that formidable harbourer of Wesleyan chaplains .
`` I wanted to talk to you -- about some things .
Should I fling up Rawdon 's place at once and then in some extraordinary , swift manner make the fortune of Frobisher 's adjacent and closely competitive pot-bank ?
he said , alert and quiet and with the faintest note of badinage .
I was descending a steep , cobbled , excavated road between banked-up footways , perhaps six feet high , upon which , in a monotonous series , opened the living room doors of rows of dark , low cottages .
Beyond , spread a darkling marsh of homes , an infinitude of little smoking hovels , and emergent , meager churches , public-houses , board schools , and other buildings amidst the prevailing chimneys of Swathinglea .
The general effect , as one came down the hill , was of a dark compressed life beneath a very high and wide and luminous evening sky , against which these pit-wheels rose .
Just as I had become the slave of my own surprise and anger and went hither and thither with a loaded revolver , seeking and intending vague fluctuating crimes , so these two nations went about the earth , hot eared and muddle headed , with loaded navies and armies terribly ready at hand .
There was nothing but quiet imaginary thwarting on either side .
FROM that moment when I insulted old Mrs. Verrall I became representative , I was a man who stood for all the disinherited of the world .
I had no hope of pride or pleasure left in me , I was raging rebellion against God and mankind .
What the devil was he up to , was my secret preoccupation .
He fussed about me with a nervous hospitality , talking in jumpy fragments , rubbing his hands together , and taking peeps at me over and round his glasses .
I was no longer oppressed by a sense of obstacles , I felt I could grasp accidents and turn them to my advantage .
I would go now down Hacker Street to the little shoemaker 's -- get a sound , good pair of boots -- ten minutes -- and then to the railway-station -- five minutes more -- and off !
I felt as efficient and non-moral as if I was Nietzsche 's Over-man already come .
For this striving , swift thing of light and beauty was Nettie -- and this was the man for whom I had been betrayed !
Art muslin and banjoes , Chinese lanterns and frying , are leading `` notes , '' I find , in the impression of those who once knew such places well .
I saw the thing as no gathering of light hearts and gay idleness , but grimly -- after the manner of poor men poisoned by the suppression of all their cravings after joy .
Fancy a world in which the common people held love to be a sort of beastliness , own sister to being drunk !
There was a noise and spinning in my brain , a vain resistance to a dark green curtain that was falling , falling , falling , fold upon fold .
I wrote shorthand , and as there was not even a phonograph available , I went in so soon as his ankle had been dressed , and sat at his desk to write at his dictation .
It is characteristic of the odd slackness that went with the spasmodic violence of the old epoch , that the secretary could not use shorthand and that there was no telephone whatever in the place .
I know now that my presence in that room was a strange and remarkable thing , the open door , even the coming and going of Parker the secretary , innovations .
Almost unnoticed , that secrecy had dropped out of life .
When at last I was alone with these vestiges the pattern was still incomplete .
Her words grew less distinct .
There comes a day when the most variegated wife comes to the end of her tunes , and another when she ends them for the second time ; _Vita longa , ars brevis_ -- at least , as regards the art of the schoolgirl .
It is only like marrying a slightly more complicated barrel-organ .
If you are a hotel proprietor , or a school proprietor , or a day labourer , such weaknesses become a strength , of course , but not otherwise .
For a literary person -- if perchance you are a literary person -- it is altogether too dreadful .
But `` Gwendolen '' -- the majestic Gwendolen of the balcony -- '' marked his pallid yet beautiful countenance . ''
'Fair sir , ' she said , 'methinks my poor flowers were scarce worth your trouble . '
`` But that 's scarcely the idea you started with , '' I began .
Pity them , be a little sorry for them -- the poor souls can not be Blades .
He reeks with intrigue .
He may have sat on piers and talked to shop-girls , kissed housemaids , taken barmaids to music halls , conversed with painted wickedness in public places -- nothing is too much for him .
Until then his manhood is not assured .
He lives by himself in a small cottage outside the village -- hating women with an unaccountable detestation -- and apparently earns a precarious livelihood , and certainly the sincere aversion of the country side , by umpiring in matches , and playing whist and `` Nap '' with such as will not be so discreet and economical as to bow before his superior merit .
One would think I spent all my time remembering the size of my gloves .
Euphemia has great ideas of putting people at their ease , a thousand little devices for thawing the very stiffest among them with a home-like glow .
No doubt it 's a genial expedient to make your guests toast his own tea-cake : down he must go upon his knees upon your hearthrug , and his poses will melt away like the dews of the morning before the rising sun .
However , this scarcely concerns Euphemia's new entertainment .
They think , as part of that belief , that men are descended from hairy simian ancestors ; assert that even a hundred thousand years ago the ancestor was hairy -- hairy , heavy , and almost as much a brute as if he lived in Mr. Arthur Morrison's Whitechapel .
For my own part I think it a pretty theory , and would certainly accept it were it not for one objection .
The thing I can not understand is how our ancestor lost that hair .
According to the theory of natural selection , materially favourable variations survive , unfavourable disappear ; the only way in which the loss is to be accounted for is by explaining it as advantageous ; but where is the advantage of losing your hair ?
In very hot countries hair is perhaps even more important in saving the possessor from the excessive glare of the sun .
Before the invention of the hat , thick hair on the head at least was absolutely essential to save the owner of the skull from sunstroke .
And , as we have indicated , watering-places and staying by the seaside are incompatible things .
Having purchased what he needs he flees forth again .
But this is a gloomy train of thought that we will not pursue .
I can assure you this is no exaggeration , but a portrait .
It seems to me that the thing must be pathological , that he and this goodness of his have exactly the same claim upon Lombroso , let us say , as the born criminal .
He ought to have the seat of his ideals lanced , and all this wash about doing good to people by stealth taken away .
As the moon rises , heaven will be flooded with blue light , and one after another the stars will be submerged and lost , until only a solitary shining pinnacle of brightness will here and there remain out of the whole host of them .
Then , for an interval , we look , as if out of a window , into the great deep of heaven .
You did not come to see your dead grandfather , nor did you know very much about the funeral .
I have put by a photograph of my father for you as he lay in that last stillness of his , that you will see at a properer time .
`` What are _you_ going to do with your life , Steve ? ''
You have to face this reality as you must face all reality .
This is reality , just as the cat 's way with the nestlings was reality , and the squealing rat one smashed in a paroxysm of cruelty and disgust in the barn .
Indeed I wanted to devote all my being to her .
There must have been days of friendly intercourse when it seemed we talked nothings and wandered and meandered among subjects , but always we had our eyes on one another .
I would invent ingenious things to say , things pushing out suddenly from nothingness to extreme significance .
I would post to her so that the letters reached Landor House before lunch time when the sun of Lady Ladislaw came over the horizon , but indeed as yet no one was watching her letters .
That look in Rachel 's eyes remained with me .
My mind had flashed very rapidly from the realization of its significance to the thought that if one could be sure of that , then indeed one could pitch oneself high .
Rachel , I felt , had something for me that I needed profoundly , without ever having known before that I needed it .
I walked over on the second occasion , and Ridinghanger opened out , a great flower of genial appreciation that I came alone , hiding nothing of its dawning perception that it was Rachel in particular I came to see .
Forced , unreal things for the most part .
You I expect have done -- all sorts of things also ... .
The house is very quiet to-day .
Presently I shall join you .
The sunlit garden , with its tall dreaming lilies against the trellised vines upon the wall , the cedars and the grassy space about the sundial , have that distinguished stillness , that definite , palpable and almost outlined emptiness which is so to speak your negative presence .
It is like a sheet of sunlit colored paper out of which your figures have been cut .
I take up this writing again after an interval of some weeks .
I have been in Paris , attending the Sabotage Conference , and dealing with those intricate puzzles of justice and discipline and the secret sources of contentment that have to be solved if sabotage is ever to vanish from labor struggles again .
We sat down side by side upon the warm pine needles that carpeted the sand , and she made a mothering fuss about my petty wound , and bound it in my handkerchief .
`` Anyone , '' she said , `` might have seen us this minute . ''
Let me talk to him . ''
He was I think amazed beyond measure at this revelation of the possibilities of his cold and distant wife , with a vast passion of jealousy awaking in him , and absolutely incapable of forming any plan to meet the demands of his extraordinary situation .
Guy and Philip got to him that night , Tarvrille came down next morning , and Martens became a debate .
Justin did not so much express views and intentions as have them extracted from him ; it was manifest he was prepared for the amplest forgiveness of his wife if only I could be obliterated from their world .
Yes , all this makes it very plain , of course .
Stupid thing , scandal is ... .
`` What might you be wanting ? ''
`` One does n't want to be a flatulent ass of course , '' said Tarvrille , `` still -- -- ''
But I urged that that I could not do ; there was the thought of Mary subjugated and weeping , the smarting memory of injury and defeat , the stains of subterfuge and discovery , the aching separation .
Do not forget , but for the present this leads you no whither ; this chapter has ended ; dismiss it and turn to those other things .
You are not only Stephen Stratton who fell into adultery ; in these silences he is a little thing and far away ; here and with me you are Man -- Everyman -- in this round world in which your lot has fallen .
To go from Europe to Asia is like going from Norway to Russia , from something slight and `` advanced '' to something massive and portentous .
I think I have got something understandable out of it all .
This present phase of human living -- its symbol at Delhi is now , I suppose , a scaffold-bristling pile of neo-Georgian building -- is the latest of the constructive synthetic efforts to make a newer and fuller life for mankind .
She did not answer for a few moments .
You know I have never quite believed in myself , never quite believed in my work or my religion .
I can not cheat my mind away from these convictions .
Some things are to be reached best by a hearing that is not distracted by any clearer senses .
`` I am afraid he will . ''
... Have n't I seen the ruin and the shame , the hopeless trap , men 's trust in me gone , my work scattered and ended again , my children growing up to hear this and that exaggeration of our story .
All the bravery of your life scattered and wasted .
`` You were wrong in all that , '' I said .
We never planned to meet and when we met -- -- .
Could it really be -- ?
He held it before him , staring now quite frankly .
It had been written with a stylographic pen .
`` I say , '' he said with a fearful sense of his temerity , and raising his mortar-board awkwardly as though he was passing a funeral .
`` Let us go on now , '' she said abruptly .
At first he had imagined headmasters clutching at the chance of him , and presently he found himself clutching eagerly at them .
He began to put a certain urgency into his applications for vacant posts , an urgency that helped him not at all .
The applications grew longer and longer until they ran to four sheets of note-paper -- a pennyworth in fact .
He was willing to do what he could to help Lewisham , in spite of the way he had been treated , but unfortunately his conscience ... .
He found the little old lady of the wallflowers with a candle in her window , and drank a bottle of ginger beer with a sacramental air .
`` I 'll certainly bring her , '' he said .
Talking to the little old lady somehow blunted his sense of desolation .
It was in Old English lettering and evidently very carefully executed .
`` You must n't waste your money , and besides , I have that ring . ''
That night Ethel had Lewisham 's company again on her way home , and their voices were earnest .
She looked at him with puzzled eyes -- still practical -- making the suggestion arithmetical .
I was just a little afraid -- Something in your manner .
It is n't as though I had n't one .
In a way you might almost say I had a mission .
`` Ethel is yours , '' said Chaffery .
The sooner the typewriter came the better .
It brought their `` law '' down to twelve or thirteen weeks .
`` Church of England .
Every man in this country who has not dissented belongs to the Church of England .
`` It 's not so much ability as willingness to teach , you know .
And _they_ wo n't find you out .
Some of these subjects -- There 's commercial geography , for instance .
The College of Pedagogues presented itself as a long-bearded , corpulent , comfortable person with a thin gold watch chain and fat hands .
He made the emendations with grave carefulness .
He took the cheque round to his grocer .
_I_ do n't know the man or what he is .
Leave the change till then .
Lagune produced some keys and got out his cheque book .
Then he hit upon a collateral proof .
`` But look here !
Can you see _this_ counterfoil ? ''
Her silence astonished him .
For nearly twenty seconds perhaps they sat without speaking .
It is no doubt an optimistic enterprise .
( You figure him doing it . )
His voice rises and falls , and sometimes he holds my arm .
The Utopians will certainly control this trade , and as certainly punish personal excesses .
In no region of intellectual activity will our hypothesis of freedom from tradition be of more value in devising a Utopia than here .
The facts were ignored that trade is a bye-product and not an essential factor in social life , that property is a plastic and fluctuating convention , that value is capable of impersonal treatment only in the case of the most generalised requirements .
The old edifice oppresses us still , repaired and altered by indifferent builders , underpinned in places , and with a slight change of name .
Now Newton , Darwin , Dalton , Davy , Joule , and Adam Smith did not affect this `` expert '' hankey-pankey , becoming enough in a hairdresser or a fashionable physician , but indecent in a philosopher or a man of science .
And so we had our first glimpse of what Utopia did with the feeble and insane .
One day , while we are still waiting there for the public office to decide about us , he broaches the matter .
It is early evening , and we are walking beside the lake after our simple dinner .
It 's so strange to have seen them so recently , and now not to see them at all ... .
He looks up for a moment at my face , and then carelessly at my wonderful new world .
`` Where is the train for London ? ''
we say , simultaneously , and laugh together .
The Base have a narrower and more persistent egoistic reference than the common run of humanity ; they may boast , but they have no frankness ; they have relatively great powers of concealment , and they are capable of , and sometimes have an aptitude and inclination towards , cruelty .
They count as an antagonism to the State organisation .
But are n't there people who can not pass examinations ? ''
In this matter , as in all matters of natural desire , they held no appetite must be glutted , no appetite must have artificial whets , and also and equally that no appetite should be starved .
And , in the matter of love , a straight and clean desire for a clean and straight fellow-creature was our Founders ' ideal .
They enjoined marriage between equals as the samurai 's duty to the race , and they framed directions of the precisest sort to prevent that uxorious inseparableness , that connubiality which will reduce a couple of people to something jointly less than either .
That Canon is too long to tell you now .
A man under the Rule who loves a woman who does not follow it , must either leave the samurai to marry her , or induce her to accept what is called the Woman 's Rule , which , while it excepts her from the severer qualifications and disciplines , brings her regimen of life into a working harmony with his . ''
It was no bird at all , but a youth with an extremely beautiful face , clad in a robe of saffron and with iridescent wings , across whose pinions great waves of colour , flushes of purple and crimson , golden green and intense blue , pursued one another as he writhed in his agony .
Twice the Angel raised himself , only to fall over sideways again .
The Vicar 's hand went up to his chin .
Now Mendham could bully his Vicar cheerfully enough , just as he could bully his congregation ; but he was not the sort of man to bully a stranger .
He looked at the Angel , and the `` strange woman '' theory was disposed of .
`` But surely -- -- ''
`` Have you any objection to my hearing ... . ''
`` Mornin ' , '' said the first person smiling weakly .
I'm sure that 's him .
I can see the hump .
Unless it 's a man with a sack .
Bless me , Minnie !
Yes , it 's the man .
`` Mr Wilmerdings is an accomplished pianist , '' interrupted the Vicar .
`` I think , '' said the Angel , very softly , leaning forward , `` I think I have found it . ''
`` The pain 's gone . ''
A woman who was walking along the footpath across the Cliff Field saw only a twisted hunchback dressed in the Vicar of Siddermorton 's cast-off clothes , sprawling foolishly at the edge of the cliff and with his forehead on his arm .
`` I was standing near her .
I heerd her -- Just like that !
That is much more important to our modern world than the ancient conflict of Assyria and Egypt which plays so large a part in the old Bible record .
Let me with this _Book of Forecasts_ round off my fantasy .
I would picture to you this modern Bible , perhaps two or three times as bulky as the old Bible , and consisting first of
We can not get our modern community educated to anything like its full possibilities as yet because we have neither the teachers nor the schools .
It has spread recently because in recent years the world has changed so rapidly that the idea of settling down for life has passed out of our minds , has given place to a new realization of the need of continuous adaptation to the very end of our days .
It is no good settling down in a world that , on its part , refuses to do anything of the sort .
Presently the trees began to thin out , and then came a regiment of nettles barring the way .
Far away by the river was the cluster of alders where she had hidden .
And at the sight of that the fear of Uya returned , and she crept into a thicket of bracken , out of which a rabbit scuttled , and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place .
When night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could cut off either of the ledge 's occupants .
The ledge was empty , there were no signs of the red thing , but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter long that night , but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn .
He forgot about the drab animals .
He found a fawn , but the doe was close by and made an ugly fight for her young .
Andoo had to leave the fawn , but as her blood was up she stuck to the attack , and at last he got in a blow of his paw on her nose , and so got hold of her .
More meat but less delicacy , and the she-bear , following , had her share .
I suppose you do n't read books ? ''
Under the stars one may reach upward and touch resignation , whatever the evil thing may be , but in the heat and stress of the day 's work we lapse again , come disgust and anger and intolerable moods .
Now was the crisis , and all the little nerves of Denton 's being seemed leaping and dancing .
He stopped his press and turned .
On'y pluck ai n't no good -- ai n't no brasted good -- if you do n't 'old your 'ands .
`` I 've had rough handling , '' he said , and gasped .
I do n't want to talk about it . ''
He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind , though he felt he did a foolish thing .
The candle was raised , hung in the air one giddy moment , and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped , fell with a smash on his toilet-table , leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick .
`` Looky here , Mr. Beamish , '' said Mr. Fotheringay .
It 's something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of Will ... . ''
For a minute , perhaps , she stood motionless .
`` Who 's been killing calves here ?
Take me out of it . ''
`` I have _created_ birds , '' he said in a low voice .
A little off colour , too -- owing to dietary .
And there was n't any particular restriction of the demand either .
You 'd have thought five ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman .
If you come to think of it --
The white figure was coming along the pathway through the corn .
It 's right what I 'm saying .
With that my suspicions returned .
He emptied the little flask and staggered -- obsequious hands assisting him -- to his feet .
That night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane .
He knew he was slipping , and he battled for his sanity with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins .

THE LIVES OF THE ENGLISH POETS .
By SAMUEL JOHNSON , LL.D .
All that is best and most representative of Congreve 's genius is included in this latest edition , wherein for the first time the chaotic punctuation of its forerunners is reduced to order -- a necessary , thankless task on which Mr. Street has manifestly spent much pains .
Of his introduction it remains to say that it is an excellent appreciation , notable for catholicity , discretion , and finesse : an admirable piece of work . '
, Rector of Yattendon , Berks .
Baring Gould has a keen eye for colour and effect , and the subjects he has chosen give ample scope to his descriptive and analytic faculties .
A perfectly fascinating book . '
'Full of quaint and delightful studies of character . '
