`` This is his writing-table .
`` You would think us horribly dull , '' Denham agreed .
`` No -- because we 're not in the least ridiculous .
`` We do n't live at Highgate , but we 're middle class too , I suppose . ''
`` She 'll do ... .
The desire to justify himself , which had been so urgent , ceased to torment him , and , as if released from constraint , so that they worked without friction or bidding , his faculties leapt forward and fixed , as a matter of course , upon the form of Katharine Hilbery .
The charm , which he had tried to disown , when under the effect of it , the beauty , the character , the aloofness , which he had been determined not to feel , now possessed him wholly ; and when , as happened by the nature of things , he had exhausted his memory , he went on with his imagination .
His most daring liberty was taken with her mind , which , for reasons of his own , he desired to be exalted and infallible , and of such independence that it was only in the case of Ralph Denham that it swerved from its high , swift flight , but where he was concerned , though fastidious at first , she finally swooped from her eminence to crown him with her approval .
He gave a sigh of satisfaction ; his consciousness of his actual position somewhere in the neighborhood of Knightsbridge returned to him , and he was soon speeding in the train towards Highgate .
but Ralph paid no attention to the voice , and made off upstairs with his plate .
He set it down in a chair opposite him , and ate with a ferocity that was due partly to anger and partly to hunger .
His mother , then , was determined not to respect his wishes ; he was a person of no importance in his own family ; he was sent for and treated as a child .
By rights , he should have been sitting downstairs in the drawing-room describing his afternoon's adventures , or listening to the afternoon 's adventures of other people ; the room itself , the gas-fire , the arm-chair -- all had been fought for ; the wretched bird , with half its feathers out and one leg lamed by a cat , had been rescued under protest ; but what his family most resented , he reflected , was his wish for privacy .
`` He 's got brains , has n't he ? ''
No , the hardship must fall on him , for he was determined that his family should have as many chances of distinguishing themselves as other families had -- as the Hilberys had , for example .
`` Because , you see , the thing 's got to be settled , one way or another .
It may be said , indeed , that English society being what it is , no very great merit is required , once you bear a well-known name , to put you into a position where it is easier on the whole to be eminent than obscure .
The Alardyces had married and intermarried , and their offspring were generally profuse , and had a way of meeting regularly in each other 's houses for meals and family celebrations which had acquired a semi-sacred character , and were as regularly observed as days of feasting and fasting in the Church .
But the book must be written .
Their increment became yearly more and more unearned .
Katharine Hilbery came in rather late , and took up a position on the floor , with her back against the wall .
Why did I let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature ? ''
`` Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure ? ''
`` One does n't necessarily trample upon people 's bodies because one runs an office , '' Mary remarked .
`` No , I have n't any sisters . ''
Why , you're nothing at all without it ; you 're only half alive ; using only half your faculties ; you must feel that for yourself .
`` You do well , Denham , '' he began impulsively , `` to have nothing to do with young women .
I offer you my experience -- if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent .
I should never think of telling Katharine the truth about herself .
That would n't do at all .
`` You 're a slave like me , I suppose ? ''
Rodney lit his lamp , pulled his curtains , offered Denham a chair , and , flinging the manuscript of his paper on the Elizabethan use of Metaphor on to the table , exclaimed :
`` Perhaps , '' Denham remarked .
`` I shall look in again some time , '' Denham remarked , upon which Rodney held up his hand , containing his manuscript , without saying anything except -- '' If you like . ''
Two days later he was much surprised to find a thin parcel on his breakfast-plate , which , on being opened , revealed the very copy of Sir Thomas Browne which he had studied so intently in Rodney 's rooms .
The task which lay before her was to organize a series of entertainments , the profits of which were to benefit the society , which drooped for want of funds .
She meant to use the cumbrous machine to pick out this , that , and the other interesting person from the muddle of the world , and to set them for a week in a pattern which must catch the eyes of Cabinet Ministers , and the eyes once caught , the old arguments were to be delivered with unexampled originality .
Mary made it clear at once , by starting a fresh topic of general interest , that though she saw the humor of her colleague , she did not intend to have her laughed at .
They do n't see that small things matter , and that 's where the leakage begins , and then we find ourselves in difficulties -- I very nearly lost my temper yesterday , '' she went on , looking at Ralph with a little smile , as though he knew what happened when she lost her temper .
`` I do n't think that I tell lies , and I do n't think that Ralph tells lies , do you , Ralph ? ''
Katharine laughed , with more gayety , as it seemed to Mary , than she could properly account for .
What was she laughing at ?
Next moment , he too , rose , and nodding to Mary , as Katharine said good-bye , opened the door for her , and followed her out .
`` What are the other things ? ''
You see , I 'm always afraid that I 'm missing something -- ''
`` Still , I do n't see why you should n't go to India , '' Ralph began , in order to keep her from rising , as she threatened to do .
Here dinner was announced , and Mr. Hilbery formally led his wife downstairs on his arm .
They were all dressed for dinner , and , indeed , the prettiness of the dinner-table merited that compliment .
There was no cloth upon the table , and the china made regular circles of deep blue upon the shining brown wood .
In the middle there was a bowl of tawny red and yellow chrysanthemums , and one of pure white , so fresh that the narrow petals were curved backwards into a firm white ball .
The father and daughter would have been quite content , apparently , to eat their dinner in silence , or with a few cryptic remarks expressed in a shorthand which could not be understood by the servants .
In the first place she called them to witness that the room was darker than usual , and had all the lights turned on .
Mrs. Hilbery demanded , and Katharine was committed to giving her parents an account of her visit to the Suffrage office .
`` It 's curious , '' Mr. Hilbery continued , agreeing with his daughter , `` how the sight of one 's fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off .
One can be enthusiastic in one 's study , but directly one comes into touch with the people who agree with one , all the glamor goes .
Katharine found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation , while her father balanced his finger-tips so judiciously , and seemed to reserve so many of his thoughts for himself .
`` Why the dickens should they apply to me ? ''
She began to pace up and down the room , snatching up her duster ; but she was too much annoyed to find any relief , as yet , in polishing the backs of books .
`` My mind got running on the Hebrides , and I could n't help writing a little description of them .
She might have been a schoolmaster criticizing a child 's essay .
Her face gave Mrs. Hilbery , who watched it anxiously , no ground for hope .
And the clock was striking eleven and nothing done !
She watched her mother , now rummaging in a great brass-bound box which stood by her table , but she did not go to her help .
She cast her eyes down in irritation , and read again her mother 's musical sentences about the silver gulls , and the roots of little pink flowers washed by pellucid streams , and the blue mists of hyacinths , until she was struck by her mother 's silence .
She raised her eyes .
`` It 's the vitality of them ! ''
`` That 's what we have n't got !
`` We thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you , '' Katharine added .
I ca n't believe my ears ! ''
It was natural that she should be anxious .
Life had been so arduous for all of them from the start that she could not help dreading any sudden relaxation of his grasp upon what he held , though , as she knew from inspection of her own life , such sudden impulse to let go and make away from the discipline and the drudgery was sometimes almost irresistible .
Half proudly , and wholly anxiously , she framed such thoughts , as they sat , late at night , talking together over the gas-stove in Ralph 's bedroom .
Ralph thought for a moment , and then remarked :
Uncle Dudley dines with us to-night .
What in the world have I done with them ? ''
But I know this sort of thing does n't interest you , '' he added hastily , with a touch of peevishness .
She looked rather whimsically round the walls of the room .
She could not entirely forget William 's presence , because , in spite of his efforts to control himself , his nervousness was apparent .
said Katharine , looking at her watch .
He caught her smiling .
His theory was that every mood has its meter .
`` And though one never thinks any one good enough for the people one's fond of , he has the kindest , truest instincts , I 'm sure , and though he seems nervous and his manner is not commanding , I only think these things because it 's Katharine .
He stood watching her come towards him , and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream of her ; for the real Katharine could speak the words which seemed to crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes , and the commonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light .
`` Should I tell you if I were ? ''
Because I think you speak the truth , '' she said , searching him for proof of this apparently , with eyes now almost impersonally direct .
`` A sprig of May in her bonnet , '' Mrs. Cosham ejaculated , reminiscently .
However , '' she sighed , `` if you have a wife and seven children , and people nowadays very quickly forget your father 's name -- well , you have to take what you can get , '' she concluded .
She took her aunts upstairs , and returned , coming towards him once more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him .
`` Wo n't you sit down ? ''
and she laughed , as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the tea-party .
All things had turned to ghosts ; the whole mass of the world was insubstantial vapor , surrounding the solitary spark in his mind , whose burning point he could remember , for it burnt no more .
He had once cherished a belief , and Katharine had embodied this belief , and she did so no longer .
He saw the dun-colored race of waters and the blank shore .
Now this passion burnt on his horizon , as the winter sun makes a greenish pane in the west through thinning clouds .
`` I 've never seen sparrows so tame , '' Mary observed , by way of saying something .
`` No , '' said Ralph .
You 're half asleep ! ''
Despising the world , as usual ? ''
We wo n't interfere with you .
She shook her head .
His manner had been odd ; his deep absorption had impressed her ; there was something in him that she had not fathomed , and the mystery of his nature laid more of a spell upon her than she liked .
But we 're late -- we must begin ! ''
`` It 'll be such a great day , '' said Mrs. Seal , with a toss of her locks .
`` A great day , not only for us , but for civilization .
We do want the people after us to have a better time of it -- and so many do n't see it .
I wonder how it is that they do n't see it ? ''
She composed herself unnecessarily , however , for she had to admit , not Ralph , but Katharine and William Rodney .
But after the first disappointment , she was pleased , for she felt instantly that Katharine was a personality , and , moreover , she need not now exercise her self-control .
`` If Ralph were here , he 'd find this very dull , '' Mary thought , with a little shiver of irritation , which led her to place her rose the wrong way in the basket .
Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching , Mary stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm .
`` That 's Christopher , come in already , and gone to feed his chickens , '' she said .
Looking now and then at the sky , she went through the list of her cousins ' names : Eleanor , Humphrey , Marmaduke , Silvia , Henry , Cassandra , Gilbert , and Mostyn -- Henry , the cousin who taught the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin , was the only one in whom she could confide , and as she walked up and down beneath the hoops of the pergola , she did begin a little speech to him , which ran something like this :
`` To begin with , I 'm very fond of William .
You ca n't deny that .
Besides , you know what our house is .
It is n't that I have n't the time at home -- it 's the atmosphere . ''
`` That certainly seems to explain some of your actions , '' Henry thought to himself .
Tremendously to his surprise , he saw the tears stand in her eyes .
They were , indeed , descending the shaft in a small cage , and could hear the picks of the miners , something like the gnawing of rats , in the earth beneath them , when the door was burst open , without any knocking .
But Rodney enjoyed the courage which springs from that laughable and lovable defect , and when he had mastered his first impulse , in some way to make a fool of himself , he drew inspiration from the perfect fit of his evening dress .
In truth , he had heard very little about him , one way or another , accepting him as a figure often to be found in the background at his aunt 's house , and inevitably , though inexplicably , engaged to his cousin .
When the sun shone , as it did with unusual brightness that Christmas week , it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well-kept-up in Stogdon House and its grounds .
`` It 's so very pleasant , '' said Lady Otway , `` to knit while one 's talking .
`` I never SHALL know my way about this house ! ''
for she was saying something that she had never said , all these years , to Maggie herself .
`` Do you know , Mary , '' Ralph suddenly interrupted her , `` I 've made up my mind . ''
`` I was unhappy -- very unhappy , '' he repeated .
Here was an opportunity for making himself face it , as he felt that he ought to ; for , by this time , no doubt , it was only a sentimental ghost , better exorcised by ruthless exposure to such an eye as Mary 's , than allowed to underlie all his actions and thoughts as had been the case ever since he first saw Katharine Hilbery pouring out tea .
He must begin , however , by mentioning her name , and this he found it impossible to do .
It was Mary who spoke for both of them .
About two miles from Lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit of the heath , a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite , setting forth the gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century who had been set upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered from death just as hope seemed lost .
`` I 've not enjoyed my holiday . ''
She noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to answer none of them , although the last stung her to considerable irritation .
She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay .
he thought to himself .
And then he could not see her come into a room without a sense of the flowing of robes , of the flowering of blossoms , of the purple waves of the sea , of all things that are lovely and mutable on the surface but still and passionate in their heart .
`` You make yourself think things you do n't think , '' he continued , becoming demonstrative with his hands , as his manner was .
-- like any other woman who is about to be married .
Now , for no reason whatever , you begin to fret about your feeling and about my feeling , with the usual result .
To let you into a secret , '' he continued , with his little chuckle , which now sounded almost assured , `` I 've often gone home from seeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force myself to write a page or two before I could get you out of my head .
Ask Denham ; he'll tell you how he met me one night ; he 'll tell you what a state he found me in . ''
`` In most ways , at least in the important ways , as you said , we know each other and we think alike .
-- we should make each other happy . ''
According to his plan , it was to be distributed in immense quantities immediately , in order to stimulate and generate , `` to generate and stimulate , '' he repeated , `` right thoughts in the country before the meeting of Parliament . ''
she thought bitterly , connecting Katharine and Ralph in a conspiracy to take from her even this hour of solitary study , even this poor little defence against the world .
My father always says that he 's the most remarkable of the young men who write for him . ''
Katharine 's mention of Ralph had roused within her an almost irresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case between herself and Ralph .
Moreover , she liked Katharine ; she trusted her ; she felt a respect for her .
The first step of confidence was comparatively simple ; but a further confidence had revealed itself , as Katharine spoke , which was not so simple , and yet it impressed itself upon her as a necessity ; she must tell Katharine what it was clear that she had no conception of -- she must tell Katharine that Ralph was in love with her .
It was a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity occurred to her ; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark ; by its light Katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the mediocrity , indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own feelings so far as they pretended to correspond with Mary 's feelings .
So in broad daylight one might revisit the place where one has groped and turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog .
`` There are so many things that she does n't understand , '' he reflected , glancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside .
They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late .
Nevertheless , her mere presence moved him strangely ; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her ; to get at the truth about her .
She had time to reflect that she gained something by all this , though it was too soon to determine what .
She had been prepared to meet opposition , which is simple to encounter compared with -- she did not know what it was that she had to encounter .
Music was not a subject about which she knew anything , but she liked him to tell her things ; and could , she mused , as he talked , fancy the evenings of married life spent thus , over the fire ; spent thus , or with a book , perhaps , for then she would have time to read her books , and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused mind what she longed to know .
She looked up apprehensively , brushing aside these thoughts with annoyance .
`` Where should I address a letter to Cassandra ? ''
It was obvious again that William had some meaning or other to-night , or was in some mood .
`` We 've struck up a friendship , '' he added .
Let me choose a book . ''
As she pulled one book forward and then another she thought ironically of her own certainty not an hour ago ; how it had vanished in a moment , how she was merely marking time as best she could , not knowing in the least where they stood , what they felt , or whether William loved her or not .
More and more the condition of Mary 's mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable -- if , indeed , it could be quite as she figured it -- if , indeed , simplicity existed for any one of the daughters of women .
His obvious wish to explain something puzzled her , interested her , and neutralized the wound to her vanity .
She ceased , as if defining to herself this peculiar charm .
William exclaimed , flinging himself back in his chair , and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire .
`` I really don't know what we 're talking about ... .
I assure you ... . ''
He paced once up and down the room , and then flung himself impetuously into the chair by Katharine 's side .
That afternoon on the heath -- it was then -- then -- '' He broke off ; he did not tell her what had happened then .
`` Your ghastly good sense , as usual , has convinced me -- for the moment -- but what the truth is , Heaven only knows ! ''
She sighed , involuntarily .
She had been hoping all this time , with an intensity that increased second by second against the current of her words , that it would not in the end come to this .
-- that 's sad ... .
You must give me your address .
She thought of three different scenes ; she thought of Mary sitting upright and saying , `` I 'm in love -- I 'm in love '' ; she thought of Rodney losing his self-consciousness among the dead leaves , and speaking with the abandonment of a child ; she thought of Denham leaning upon the stone parapet and talking to the distant sky , so that she thought him mad .
They were the lantern-bearers , whose lights , scattered among the crowd , wove a pattern , dissolving , joining , meeting again in combination .
All she achieved by her thinking was the conviction that , in such a cause , no risk was too great ; and that , far from making any rules for herself or others , she would let difficulties accumulate unsolved , situations widen their jaws unsatiated , while she maintained a position of absolute and fearless independence .
He found a letter from Cassandra waiting for him .
She knew , she wrote , that her praise meant absolutely nothing ; but still , she had sat up all night ; she thought this , that , and the other ; she was full of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places , but enough was written plain to gratify William 's vanity exceedingly .
She was quite intelligent enough to say the right things , or , even more charmingly , to hint at them .
In other ways , too , it was a very charming letter .
She told him about her music , and about a Suffrage meeting to which Henry had taken her , and she asserted , half seriously , that she had learnt the Greek alphabet , and found it `` fascinating . ''
Had she laughed when she drew that line ?
Was she ever serious ?
`` Your father , then ?
But there was no bag in the Orchid House .
It must , therefore , have been left upon the seat .
He began slipping his smooth , silver watch in his pocket , in the hope that somehow he might help himself back to that calm and fatalistic mood which had been his when he looked at its face upon the bank of the lake , for that mood must , at whatever cost , be the mood of his intercourse with Katharine .
I could undertake , at this instant , '' he continued , with a reasonable intonation which did much credit to his self-control , `` to lay down terms for a friendship which should be perfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward . ''
I must write the man 's name down at once , or I shall forget -- ''
`` I 'm thinking of leaving our friends in Russell Square , '' Mary explained .
`` I should like to start something -- something off one 's own bat -- that 's what I should like . ''
Other societies , which shall be nameless , have gone under because they 've appealed only to cranks .
`` You ca n't wander about the streets alone in those clothes , '' said Mary , but the desire to find a cab was not her true reason for standing beside Katharine for a minute or two .
It may have been their common womanhood .
`` I think he seems able to take care of himself , '' Katharine observed .
`` Remember , I want to belong to your society -- remember , '' she added , having to raise her voice a little , and shutting the door upon the rest of her words .
She dismissed the question as she asked it , scorning herself for applying such simple measures to the rare and splendid emotions of so unique a couple .
She forgot all about the psychology of animals , and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown , and became instantly engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could administer consolation , and she hoped that Katharine would keep ahead with Mr. Denham , as a child who plays at being grown-up hopes that her mother wo n't come in just yet , and spoil the game .
Or was it not rather that she had ceased to play at being grown-up , and was conscious , suddenly , that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest ?
`` I hope you 've had a pleasant afternoon , '' William remarked .
When they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom of Highgate , she wondered , for the first time , where he was taking her .
Had he a family , or did he live alone in rooms ?
On the whole she was inclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged , and possibly invalid , mother .
She sketched lightly , upon the blank vista down which they walked , the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising from behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering words about `` my son 's friends , '' and was on the point of asking Ralph to tell her what she might expect , when he jerked open one of the infinite number of identical wooden doors , and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the Alpine style of architecture .
she asked , without concealing her dismay .
`` Mother , this is Miss Hilbery , '' he said .
`` The ceiling 's fallen down in the pantry again , '' said Hester , a girl of eighteen , abruptly .
And Katharine , glancing back at Joan , who smiled at her in a preoccupied way , followed Ralph upstairs .
They were silent for a space .
`` For ever , so far as I 'm concerned , '' he replied .
They sat side by side without speaking , and Mary reached her hand for her work basket , and took out her sewing and threaded a needle .
`` I 'm glad you thought so .
It 's tremendously interesting work , and considering everything , I think we 've done very well .
But I 'm inclined to agree with you ; we ought to try to be more conciliatory .
`` I 'm afraid no third person can do anything to help , '' she added .
`` Do you want to be working now ? ''
`` My God , Denham , what fools we both are ! ''
They seemed to confess to each other the extreme depths of their folly .
`` D'you know what time it is ? ''
We might disturb your father , '' Mrs. Milvain objected , taking the precaution to speak in a whisper already .
`` She 's been spying upon us , '' she said , `` following us about London , overhearing what people are saying -- ''
`` Everything we 've done for a fortnight has been seen . ''
He believed instinctively what Katharine said , but what it meant to him he was unable to understand .
Could she have told Katharine that she loved him ?
The desire to know the truth of this was urgent , unknown though the consequences might be .
He looked at her , with doubt , and with anxiety , but said nothing .
`` I must be first with him , Katharine ! ''
`` What is it ? ''
`` He 's not there ! ''
You must have been cold .
`` You 're glad ? ''
`` And then you went raving about the streets , '' she mused .
`` Because if you 're in love with a vision , I believe that that 's what I'm in love with . ''
( `` The windows of the soul , '' she added parenthetically . )
Some of them looked very handsome , too , in their wigs .
`` And all the things that are n't written down , but -- but -- '' She waved her hand , as if to indicate the wealth of unwritten poetry all about them .
Ah dear , '' she sighed , `` well , the sunset is very lovely too .
The house was oddly different without her .
Katharine found the maids already in possession of her room , which they meant to clean thoroughly during her absence .
To Katharine it seemed as if they had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters .
The china shepherdesses were already shining from a bath of hot water .
The prospect appalled her .
It was to this effect :
Either she 's engaged to him -- or -- ''
Katharine checked her with an impatient movement , and said :
I only thought we might amuse ourselves , as your uncle 's out . ''
Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when I question her ?
I understand the reason now .
Mr. Hilbery 's face turned a curious dull purple .
He looked at his daughter .
`` I 'll come back , '' she said , and as she spoke she opened the door and went out .
He sighed impatiently , and said nothing for a moment .
`` Nothing else matters in the world ! ''
I knew it from the first .
said Mrs. Hilbery , with a slight note of disappointment in her voice .
`` I had my little romance -- my little speculation . ''
Mrs. Hilbery inquired innocently .
Her mind and body both seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing clouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in a vaporous indistinctness .
Meanwhile he remained conscious of his own concentrated desire , his impotence to bring about anything he wished , and his increasing agony of impatience .
`` You go in , Denham .
Mrs. Hilbery led the way upstairs .
She blushed very deeply ; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her face she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences , or Ralph likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to fold themselves within reach of his hand .
The bewilderment was half shame and half the prelude to profound rejoicing .
She bent her head once more to the papers she held .
Her old faith came back to her .
`` But it was then I first knew I loved you ! ''
`` No , I 'm a person who ca n't tell things , '' she pleaded .
They stood for some moments , looking at the illuminated blinds , an expression to them both of something impersonal and serene in the spirit of the woman within , working out her plans far into the night -- her plans for the good of a world that none of them were ever to know .
Then their minds jumped on and other little figures came by in procession , headed , in Ralph 's view , by the figure of Sally Seal .
Again we told her not to wander from the point , -- did the Oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good books ?
-- the objects of life .
`` I move , '' said Helen , `` that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or unchastity save those who are in love . ''
The marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations , and , as we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air , talks across space , penetrates to the heart of an atom , and embraces the universe in his speculations , a murmur of admiration burst from our lips .
`` What a bore she is ! ''
`` Nothing -- nothing -- nothing whatever , '' she replied .
But is n't it wonderful , '' she broke off -- '' Mr. Chitter has written a weekly article for the past thirty years upon love or hot buttered toast and has sent all his sons to Eton -- -- ''
So we rattled through Surrey and across the border into Sussex .
That 's the man 's way ; that 's the sound that reverberates ; that 's St. Paul 's and the motor-omnibuses .
`` I can bear it no longer , '' her spirit says .
Oh , heavens , her sob !
Oh , there he is !
That 's my son . ''
Then watch that elderly face against the dark canvas , a moment ago urbane and flushed ; now taciturn and sad , as if in shadow .
Flourish , spring , burgeon , burst !
But the waters of the Rhone flow swift and deep , race under the arches , and sweep the trailing water leaves , washing shadows over the silver fish , the spotted fish rushed down by the swift waters , now swept into an eddy where -- it 's difficult this -- conglomeration of fish all in a pool ; leaping , splashing , scraping sharp fins ; and such a boil of current that the yellow pebbles are churned round and round , round and round -- free now , rushing downwards , or even somehow ascending in exquisite spirals into the air ; curled like thin shavings from under a plane ; up and up ... .
How lovely goodness is in those who , stepping lightly , go smiling through the world !
`` Good night , good night .
`` They make you pay sixpence on Friday . ''
`` Wherever _does_ one have one 's tea ? ''
How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object , lifting it a little way , as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly , and then leave it ... .
If that mark was made by a nail , it ca n't have been for a picture , it must have been for a miniature -- the miniature of a lady with white powdered curls , powder-dusted cheeks , and lips like red carnations .
A fraud of course , for the people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that way -- an old picture for an old room .
That is the sort of people they were -- very interesting people , and I think of them so often , in such queer places , because one will never see them again , never know what happened next .
They wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture , so he said , and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it when we were torn asunder , as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train .
The wonder is that I 've any clothes on my back , that I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment .
Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office !
With one 's hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse .
The window shook , and Rebecca stole like a cat and wedged it .
Yes -- she 's still on the pier .
There 's no pier beneath us .
Cannon-balls ; arrow-heads ; Roman glass and a forceps green with verdigris .
For he asked for a parish in Sheffield , which was given him ; and , sending for Archer , Jacob , and John to say good-bye , he told them to choose whatever they liked in his study to remember him by .
Then Mr. Floyd spoke about the King 's Navy ( to which Archer was going ) ; and about Rugby ( to which Jacob was going ) ; and next day he received a silver salver and went -- first to Sheffield , where he met Miss Wimbush , who was on a visit to her uncle , then to Hackney -- then to Maresfield House , of which he became the principal , and finally , becoming editor of a well-known series of Ecclesiastical Biographies , he retired to Hampstead with his wife and daughter , and is often to be seen feeding the ducks on Leg of Mutton Pond .
As for Mrs. Flanders 's letter -- when he looked for it the other day he could not find it , and did not like to ask his wife whether she had put it away .
Meeting Jacob in Piccadilly lately , he recognized him after three seconds .
The tree had fallen the night he caught it .
There had been a volley of pistol-shots suddenly in the depths of the wood .
Miles away from home , in a hollow among teasles beneath a ruin , he had found the commas .
He had seen a white admiral circling higher and higher round an oak tree , but he had never caught it .
`` Move me , '' she would say to Mr. Dickens , after sitting on the esplanade for fifteen minutes .
At the first command he would seek the sun ; at the second he would stay the chair there in the bright strip .
And Herbert looked at the moon .
The Moonlight Sonata tinkled away ; the waltz crashed .
Certainly there was a sense of concentration in the air .
Behind the grey walls sat so many young men , some undoubtedly reading , magazines , shilling shockers , no doubt ; legs , perhaps , over the arms of chairs ; smoking ; sprawling over tables , and writing while their heads went round in a circle as the pen moved -- simple young men , these , who would -- but there is no need to think of them grown old ; others eating sweets ; here they boxed ; and , well , Mr. Hawkins must have been mad suddenly to throw up his window and bawl : `` Jo -- seph !
Jo -- seph ! ''
and then he ran as hard as ever he could across the court , while an elderly man , in a green apron , carrying an immense pile of tin covers , hesitated , balanced , and then went on .
Anyhow , Jacob , who sat astride a chair and ate dates from a long box , burst out laughing .
Possibly , when he had done arranging the date-stones , he might find something to say to it -- indeed his lips opened -- only then there broke out a roar of laughter .
`` Yes , '' said Timmy , after reflection .
`` That is so . ''
`` Not BEFORE the fish -- with it , Mrs. Durrant , '' said Charlotte Wilding .
But I ca n't see Bonamy down there .
Meanwhile , where had the other woman got to ?
`` You shall sit by my mother , '' said Clara .
`` Yes , '' said Jacob .
Head bent down , a desk , a telephone , books bound in green leather , electric light ... .
`` Fresh coals , sir ? ''
The sitting-room neither knew nor cared .
These old houses are only brick and wood , soaked in human sweat , grained with human dirt .
Behind the door was the obscene thing , the alarming presence , and terror would come over her as at death , or the birth of a child .
And the fault lay with Florinda .
Indeed , when the door opened and the couple came out , Mrs. Flanders would have flounced upon her -- only it was Jacob who came first , in his dressing-gown , amiable , authoritative , beautifully healthy , like a baby after an airing , with an eye clear as running water .
Florinda followed , lazily stretching ; yawning a little ; arranging her hair at the looking-glass -- while Jacob read his mother 's letter .
Jacob took the paper over to the fire .
`` Your mother , '' she said , `` is one of my oldest friends . ''
She smiled at him .
As she shut the door he put so many shillings on the mantelpiece .
It was only `` My dear '' that she said , but her voice went jodelling between Alpine passes .
Mangin , the poet , coming up to her , stood looking down at her , drawing at his pipe .
At mid-day young women walk out into the air .
They stand by the edge of the blue pond .
The women stand round the pond , beating off great prancing shaggy dogs .
`` Pie and greens for one .
The corn squirms and abases itself as if preparing to tug itself free from the roots , and yet is tied down .
Fanny eyed them too .
A shadow fell across Evelina 's window -- Jacob 's shadow , though it was not Jacob .
And Fanny turned and walked along Gerrard Street and wished that she had read books .
She had been a great reader .
At the Slade no one read .
But no one knew Fanny at the Slade , or guessed how empty it seemed to her ; the passion for ear-rings , for dances , for Tonks and Steer -- when it was only the French who could paint , Jacob said .
For the moderns were futile ; painting the least respectable of the arts ; and why read anything but Marlowe and Shakespeare , Jacob said , and Fielding if you must read novels ?
Not going to music-halls ; not looking in at shop windows ; not wearing each other 's clothes , like Robertson who had worn her shawl , and she had worn his waistcoat , which Jacob could only do very awkwardly ; for he liked Tom Jones .
`` Well , Flanders , finished writing to your lady ? ''
said Cruttendon , as Jacob came and took his seat beside them , holding in his hand an envelope addressed to Mrs. Flanders , near Scarborough , England .
`` Now my good sir , are you going to settle down ? ''
`` Half a jiff , '' said Cruttendon .
`` Jacob 's letters are so like him , '' said Mrs. Jarvis , folding the sheet .
Did the bones stir , or the rusty swords ?
and if all the ghosts flocked thick and rubbed shoulders with Mrs. Flanders in the circle , would she not have seemed perfectly in her place , a live English matron , growing stout ?
A garnet brooch has dropped into its grass .
Yes , he knew all that ; and he admired her .
Very pleasant , he thought , to have affairs .
He threw away his cigar , went up to Jacob and asked him , with a simple sort of sincerity which Jacob liked , whether he had come straight out from England .
`` Still ... ! ''
Then they would apply themselves to Jacob and vacillate eternally between the two extremes .
He rode to hounds -- after a fashion , for he had n't a penny .
`` You could n't come to-morrow -- it would be too early ? ''
The mainland of Greece was dark ; and somewhere off Euboea a cloud must have touched the waves and spattered them -- the dolphins circling deeper and deeper into the sea .
`` What's all this about England ? ''
The Swiss waiter must see to the newcomers .
`` Well , I hope they pay you for it , '' said Jacob .
His head , with the amiable pale eyes , carried the burden of knowledge across the street ; laid it before his colleagues , who came equally burdened ; and then the sixteen gentlemen , lifting their pens or turning perhaps rather wearily in their chairs , decreed that the course of history should shape itself this way or that way , being manfully determined , as their faces showed , to impose some coherency upon Rajahs and Kaisers and the muttering in bazaars , the secret gatherings , plainly visible in Whitehall , of kilted peasants in Albanian uplands ; to control the course of events .
Jacob rose from his chair in Hyde Park , tore his ticket to pieces , and walked away .
Mrs. Durrant was taking a party to Greenwich .
`` Drink -- drugs , '' said Mr. Pepper with sinister conciseness .
Hopeless muddle , I 'm told . ''
`` Jenkinson of Cats -- d'you still keep up with him ? ''
`` That 's what comes of putting things off , and collecting fossils , and sticking Norman arches on one 's pigsties . ''
Suddenly Mrs. Chailey , turning from the subject of sheets , dismissing them entirely , clenched her fists on the top of them , and proclaimed , `` And you could n't ask a living creature to sit where I sit ! ''
Indeed if they had not been blessed in their weather , one blue day being bowled up after another , smooth , round , and flawless .
As it was , she had her embroidery frame set up on deck , with a little table by her side on which lay open a black volume of philosophy .
She chose a thread from the vari-coloured tangle that lay in her lap , and sewed red into the bark of a tree , or yellow into the river torrent .
Round her men in blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards , or leant over the rails and whistled , and not far off Mr. Pepper sat cutting up roots with a penknife .
They had scarcely spoken two words to each other since that first evening ; they were polite when they met , but there had been no confidence of any kind .
Rachel seemed to get on very well with her father -- much better , Helen thought , than she ought to -- and was as ready to let Helen alone as Helen was to let her alone .
Her efforts to come to an understanding had only hurt her aunt 's feelings , and the conclusion must be that it is better not to try .
To feel anything strongly was to create an abyss between oneself and others who feel strongly perhaps but differently .
It was far better to play the piano and forget all the rest .
It appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant , or ever talked of a feeling they felt , but that was what music was for .
Absorbed by her music she accepted her lot very complacently , blazing into indignation perhaps once a fortnight , and subsiding as she subsided now .
Like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea , rose , kissed it again , and thus rising and kissing passed finally out of sight .
`` Mr. Richard Dalloway , '' continued Vinrace , `` seems to be a gentleman who thinks that because he was once a member of Parliament , and his wife's the daughter of a peer , they can have what they like for the asking .
Said they must have passages -- produced a letter from Lord Glenaway , asking me as a personal favour -- overruled any objections Jackson made ( I do n't believe they came to much ) , and so there 's nothing for it but to submit , I suppose . ''
Momentary though it seemed , nevertheless the interruption was upsetting ; every one was more or less put out by it , from Mr. Grice , the steward , to Ridley himself .
A few minutes later Rachel passed the smoking-room , and found Helen moving arm-chairs .
Mr. Pepper had not troubled to change his neat ugly suit .
`` If any creature is so deluded as to think that a vote does him or her any good , let him have it .
Helen considered for a moment .
`` I 'd give ten years of my life to know Greek , '' she said , when he had done .
Mrs. Dalloway hid a tiny yawn , a mere dilation of the nostrils .
`` Did you ever see such a set of cranks ?
They both laughed , thinking of the same things , so that there was no need to compare their impressions .
`` It 's a fine career .
My God -- what a career ! ''
`` You 've never been to school , and you live -- ? ''
Her sidelong glance told Rachel that she found her attractive although she was inexplicably amused .
The short sketch of the Ambroses was , however , somewhat perfunctory , and contained little but the fact that Mr. Ambrose was her uncle .
But it seemed that Mrs. Dalloway was able to understand without words .
I have determined that it is a hot summer day ; I warn you that nothing you can say will shake me .
`` She is the greatest , '' he continued , `` and for this reason : she does not attempt to write like a man .
`` A searching question !
-- on the other I can fairly say this : I have not lowered my ideal . ''
`` You talk of unity , '' she said .
`` You ought to make me understand . ''
`` This is a matter I want to clear up . ''
Imagination , Miss Vinrace ; use your imagination ; that 's where you young Liberals fail .
Conceive the world as a whole .
Yet if the meanest screw fails in its task , the proper working of the whole is imperilled . ''
`` Well , then ; no woman has what I may call the political instinct .
For one second she opened a single eye , and saw that the room was tidy .
She pulled him down to her by the lapel of his coat , kissed him , and held him fast for a minute .
`` What solitary icebergs we are , Miss Vinrace !
How little we can communicate !
There are lots of things I should like to tell you about -- to hear your opinion of .
She dreamt that she was walking down a long tunnel , which grew so narrow by degrees that she could touch the damp bricks on either side .
His face was pitted and like the face of an animal .
`` You 'll have forgotten all about me by the time you step out there . ''
`` Oh , it 's time , '' said Clarissa .
People in the way made it unnecessary for Richard to shake Rachel by the hand ; he managed to look at her very stiffly for a second before he followed his wife down the ship 's side .
She made scarcely any attempt to listen to what Helen was saying , as Helen indulged in commonplaces to begin with .
`` I quite agree , '' she said , `` that people are very interesting ; only -- '' Rachel , putting her finger between the pages , looked up enquiringly .
`` Only I think you ought to discriminate , '' she ended .
`` You 'll have to find out for yourself .
But try and -- Why don't you call me Helen ? ''
`` 'Aunt 's ' a horrid name .
`` I should like to call you Helen , '' Rachel answered .
She reflected that she had never yet asked him whether he had been in love .
They had got further and further from that subject instead of drawing nearer to it , and she could not help feeling it a relief when William Pepper , with all his knowledge , his microscope , his note-books , his genuine kindliness and good sense , but a certain dryness of soul , took his departure .
Also she could not help feeling it sad that friendships should end thus , although in this case to have the room empty was something of a comfort , and she tried to console herself with the reflection that one never knows how far other people feel the things they might be supposed to feel .
However , I must retract some of the things that I have said against them .
This girl , though twenty-four , had never heard that men desired women , and , until I explained it , did not know how children were born .
Let alone the suffering to them , it explains why women are what they are -- the wonder is they 're no worse .
I have taken it upon myself to enlighten her , and now , though still a good deal prejudiced and liable to exaggerate , she is more or less a reasonable human being .
I now pray for a young man to come to my help ; some one , I mean , who would talk to her openly , and prove how absurd most of her ideas about life are .
She ceased , and with her pen in her hand sat looking into the fire , making the logs into caves and mountains , for it had grown too dark to go on writing .
The bell rang ; she rose , met Ridley and Rachel outside , and they all went in to dinner .
The faint but penetrating pulse of an electric bell could now be heard in the corridor .
The maid having answered the bell , drearily respectful even at this hour though muffled in a mackintosh , the passage was left in silence .
Downstairs all was empty and dark ; but on the upper floor a light still burnt in the room where the boots had dropped so heavily above Miss Allan 's head .
As he read he knocked the ash automatically , now and again , from his cigarette and turned the page , while a whole procession of splendid sentences entered his capacious brow and went marching through his brain in order .
`` They 're so stupid , '' said Hirst .
`` There ca n't be two opinions about that , I imagine , '' said Hirst , hopping briskly across the room , `` unless you 're in love -- that fat woman Warrington ? ''
`` Jolly little chaps , '' said Mr. Venning .
`` Look here , you 've got nothing to eat . ''
A great wedge of cake was handed Susan on the point of a trembling knife .
Her hand trembled too as she took it .
Far from looking bored or absent-minded , her eyes were concentrated almost sternly upon the page , and from her breathing , which was slow but repressed , it could be seen that her whole body was constrained by the working of her mind .
At last she shut the book sharply , lay back , and drew a deep breath , expressive of the wonder which always marks the transition from the imaginary world to the real world .
`` Monte Rosa -- that 's the mountain over there , is n't it ? ''
The party which had been suggested a few nights ago in Mr. Hirst's bedroom had taken shape and was the source of great satisfaction to Mr. Hewet , who had seldom used his practical abilities , and was pleased to find them equal to the strain .
But why do we do it ?
-- which is , on the whole , the view _I_ incline to . ''
`` They are not satisfactory ; they are ignoble , '' he thought , surveying his guests from a little distance , where he was gathering together the plates .
He glanced at them all , stooping and swaying and gesticulating round the table-cloth .
Yet these were the people with money , and to them rather than to others was given the management of the world .
You think we ought to begin things fresh .
Now and then her amazing good fortune overcame her , and she turned to Arthur with an exclamation of love .
The man then sat upright and the woman , who now appeared to be Susan Warrington , lay back upon the ground , with her eyes shut and an absorbed look upon her face , as though she were not altogether conscious .
`` I have an aunt called Rachel , who put the life of Father Damien into verse .
She is a religious fanatic -- the result of the way she was brought up , down in Northamptonshire , never seeing a soul .
`` And I wonder what they 're doing now ? ''
said Helen 's voice above them .
`` I do n't think it would be awful .
It 's quite easy to imagine .
When you go to bed to-night fold your hands so -- breathe slower and slower -- '' He lay back with his hands clasped upon his breast , and his eyes shut , `` Now , '' he murmured in an even monotonous voice , `` I shall never , never , never move again . ''
His body , lying flat among them , did for a moment suggest death .
They looked at each other as though a mist hitherto obscuring their faces had been blown away .
Hirst did not attempt to answer her platitude .
`` D'you mean to tell me you 've reached the age of twenty-four without reading Gibbon ? ''
I shall send you my copy .
Have you got a mind , or are you like the rest of your sex ?
You seem to me absurdly young compared with men of your age . ''
`` I have brought out five daughters -- and they all loved dancing !
Certainly a barrier which usually stands fast had fallen , and it was possible to speak of matters which are generally only alluded to between men and women when doctors are present , or the shadow of death .
It was long , for it was full of extremely elaborate incidents , which led on to a discussion of the principles on which morality is founded , and thus to several very interesting matters , which even in this ballroom had to be discussed in a whisper , lest one of the pouter pigeon ladies or resplendent merchants should overhear them , and proceed to demand that they should leave the place .
`` Enjoying yourself ? ''
D'you know , I believe you 're just the person I want , '' she said , as they sat down , `` to help me complete her education ?
I 've been doing what I can -- but I 'm too old , and I 'm a woman .
Why should n't you talk to her -- explain things to her -- talk to her , I mean , as you talk to me ? ''
`` Invent the steps . ''
Sure of her melody she marked the rhythm boldly so as to simplify the way .
`` My brain , on the contrary , '' said Hirst , `` is in a condition of abnormal activity . ''
`` But , '' she said , `` remember that you 've got to come and see us . ''
She was thinking of this very question , revolving the figures , as she sat in her wheeled chair with a table spread with cards by her side .
The Patience had somehow got into a muddle , and she did not like to call for Susan to help her , as Susan seemed to be busy with Arthur .
So saying , and drawing no reply from Hewet , he proceeded to think about himself , about science , about Cambridge , about the Bar , about Helen and what she thought of him , until , being very tired , he was nodding off to sleep .
In a minute they had gone in ; he could hear bolts grating then ; there was dead silence , and all the lights went out .
He was very tired , and a pale waiter kept walking ostentatiously into the middle of the room and looking at them meaningly .
What was she feeling left alone in the empty hall ?
The mystery of life and the unreality even of one 's own sensations overcame him as he walked down the corridor which led to his room .
It was dimly lighted , but sufficiently for him to see a figure in a bright dressing-gown pass swiftly in front of him , the figure of a woman crossing from one room to another .
Helen looked with a sigh at an envelope which lay upon her dressing-table .
Yes , there lay Willoughby , curt , inexpressive , perpetually jocular , robbing a whole continent of mystery , enquiring after his daughter 's manners and morals -- hoping she was n't a bore , and bidding them pack her off to him on board the very next ship if she were -- and then grateful and affectionate with suppressed emotion , and then half a page about his own triumphs over wretched little natives who went on strike and refused to load his ships , until he roared English oaths at them , `` popping my head out of the window just as I was , in my shirt sleeves .
`` Not old things -- new things , '' interrupted Mrs. Flushing curtly .
I always envy the men who break stones and sit on those nice little heaps all day wearin ' spectacles .
`` You like this ? ''
he asked in an undertone .
`` Yes , but strong , searching , unyielding in mind . ''
`` Did I ever deny it ? ''
`` She 's my first cousin !
Go on -- go on ! ''
But she could draw no conclusions , for Hewet was still reading Gibbon aloud , and Rachel , for all the expression she had , might have been a shell , and his words water rubbing against her ears , as water rubs a shell on the edge of a rock .
`` I do adore the aristocracy ! ''
`` They 're so amazingly unscrupulous .
If it comes to that , I had an aunt who died of cancer myself , but I put a bold face on it -- '' He rose and began tilting his chair backwards and forwards on its hind legs .
`` I 'd like to come , '' said Rachel .
`` But she might have said that anyhow , '' Helen thought to herself as Hewet and Rachel went away together , and Helen was left alone with St. John , to St. John 's obvious satisfaction .
From her observations at tea she was inclined to doubt whether Hirst was the person to educate Rachel .
`` She seems vague , but she 's a will of her own , '' she said , as if in the interval she had run through her qualities .
Perhaps he resented this division of attention .
He sat silent watching Helen closely .
Far away to the other side of the world as they were , in smoky rooms , and grey medieval courts , they appeared remarkable figures , free-spoken men with whom one could be at ease ; incomparably more subtle in emotion than the people here .
Should he stay on at Cambridge or should he go to the Bar ?
At last , without any preface , she pronounced her decision .
`` That is , I want to write them . ''
`` Well , '' said Hewet , `` what d'you do in the morning ? ''
There 's a pot of ferns .
Then there 's Blanche the maid , who snuffles because of her nose .
Aunt Clara has what they call a G.F.S .
I go up Richmond Hill , along the terrace , into the park .
It 's spring in England .
However , I cross the road and get on to the grass and we walk along , and I sing as I always do when I 'm alone , until we come to the open place where you can see the whole of London beneath you on a clear day .
It 's the open place that the balloons cross going over to Hurlingham .
I could tell you now how to get from place to place , and exactly what trees you 'd pass , and where you 'd cross the roads .
You see , I played there when I was small .
Spring is good , but it 's best in the autumn when the deer are barking ; then it gets dusky , and I go back through the streets , and you ca n't see people properly ; they come past very quick , you just see their faces and then they 're gone -- that 's what I like -- and no one knows in the least what you 're doing -- ''
`` My other novel , '' Hewet continued , `` is about a young man who is obsessed by an idea -- the idea of being a gentleman .
He manages to exist at Cambridge on a hundred pounds a year .
Well , he goes up to London , gets into good society , owing to an early-morning adventure on the banks of the Serpentine .
He is led into telling lies -- my idea , you see , is to show the gradual corruption of the soul -- calls himself the son of some great landed proprietor in Devonshire .
Meanwhile the coat becomes older and older , and he hardly dares to wear the trousers .
He has a friend , too , a man who somehow subsists upon selling small birds , for which he sets traps in the fields near Uxbridge .
I know one or two wretched starving creatures like that who quote Aristotle at you over a fried herring and a pint of porter .
I 'm going to describe the kind of parties I once went to -- the fashionable intellectuals , you know , who like to have the latest book on their tables .
There 's no difficulty in conceiving incidents ; the difficulty is to put them into shape -- not to get run away with , as Lady Theo was .
Does it seem to you the kind of book you 'd like to read ? ''
`` But eight o'clock does n't count here , does it ? ''
Helen and Rachel had become very silent .
Having detected , as she thought , a secret , and judging that Rachel meant to keep it from her , Mrs. Ambrose respected it carefully , but from that cause , though unintentionally , a curious atmosphere of reserve grew up between them .
Even this theory she was ready to discard in favour of one which made chaos triumphant , things happening for no reason at all , and every one groping about in illusion and ignorance .
It was so fluctuating , and went so quickly from joy to despair , that it seemed necessary to confront it with some stable opinion which naturally became dark as well as stable .
Perhaps Mrs. Ambrose had some idea that in leading the talk into these quarters she might discover what was in Rachel 's mind , but it was difficult to judge , for sometimes she would agree with the gloomiest thing that was said , at other times she refused to listen , and rammed Helen 's theories down her throat with laughter , chatter , ridicule of the wildest , and fierce bursts of anger even at what she called the `` croaking of a raven in the mud . ''
she demanded , panting slightly .
After painting for some minutes , she suddenly laid down her brush and fixed her eyes upon Rachel .
He hated the blue and white , the intensity and definiteness , the hum and heat of the south ; the landscape seemed to him as hard and as romantic as a cardboard background on the stage , and the mountain but a wooden screen against a sheet painted blue .
He walked fast in spite of the heat of the sun .
Finally , Hirst 's odious words flicked his mind like a whip , and he remembered that he had left her talking to Hirst .
Supposing that there were an understanding between them , what would it mean to him ?
Supposing he went to her and said ( he slackened his pace and began to speak aloud , as if he were speaking to Rachel ) :
Would any woman have behaved like that -- if a man had said he did n't want her ?
We 've too much self-respect ; we 're infinitely finer than they are . ''
Rachel sat watching her .
`` It must have been in those bushes . ''
`` I daresay I should n't like preserved ginger . ''
`` People say youth is pleasant ; I myself find middle age far pleasanter , '' she remarked , removing hair pins and combs , and taking up her brush .
Since the time of Elizabeth very few people had seen the river , and nothing has been done to change its appearance from what it was to the eyes of the Elizabethan voyagers .
Changing only with the change of the sun and the clouds , the waving green mass had stood there for century after century , and the water had run between its banks ceaselessly , sometimes washing away earth and sometimes the branches of trees , while in other parts of the world one town had risen upon the ruins of another town , and the men in the towns had become more and more articulate and unlike each other .
Susan and Arthur had seen it as they kissed each other , and Terence and Rachel as they sat talking about Richmond , and Evelyn and Perrott as they strolled about , imagining that they were great captains sent to colonise the world .
`` I shall sit down here , '' she announced , pointing to the trunk of a tree which had fallen long ago and was now laced across and across by creepers and thong-like brambles .
She turned her back to the trees which disappeared in black shadow behind her .
It seemed to Terence as he listened to them talking , that existence now went on in two different layers .
But with something of a child 's directness , Mrs. Flushing had also the instinct which leads a child to suspect what its elders wish to keep hidden .
She fixed Terence with her vivid blue eyes and addressed herself to him in particular .
No , no , '' she laughed , `` not one scrap -- do n't tell me .
One reads a lot about love -- that 's why poetry 's so dull .
It ai n't love ! ''
`` And in my opinion , '' he continued , `` the absence of population to which Hirst objects is precisely the significant touch .
`` And that , I think , is what my wife feels , the essential superiority of the peasant -- '' Under cover of Mr. Flushing's words , which continued now gently reasoning with St. John and persuading him , Terence drew Rachel to the side , pointing ostensibly to a great gnarled tree-trunk which had fallen and lay half in the water .
Fragments of their talk came out distinctly as they passed -- art , emotion , truth , reality .
He had been looking forward to this expedition as to a holiday , for , once away from the hotel , surely wonderful things would happen , instead of which nothing happened , and here they were as uncomfortable , as restrained , as self-conscious as ever .
He had lain awake all night thinking , and when it was light enough to see , he had written twenty lines of his poem on God , and the awful thing was that he'd practically proved the fact that God did not exist .
He did not see that he was teasing her , and he went on to wonder what would happen if God did exist -- '' an old gentleman in a beard and a long blue dressing gown , extremely testy and disagreeable as he 's bound to be ?
God , rod , sod -- all used ; any others ? ''
Nevertheless , although their position some yards in advance of the others made it possible for them to say anything they chose , they were both silent .
They begged her , however , to continue , with such earnestness in their voices , as if they only craved advice , that she was led to add :
`` ' -- all possible wishes for all possible happiness , ' '' he read ; `` correct , but not very vivid , are they ? ''
`` We must have a son and we must have a daughter , '' said Terence , putting down the letters , `` because , let alone the inestimable advantage of being our children , they 'd be so well brought up . ''
`` We 're wasting the morning -- I ought to be writing my book , and you ought to be answering these . ''
`` My dear Evelyn -- ''
Far more than upon the nature of sex they dwelt upon the nature of poetry , but it was true that talk which had no boundaries deepened and enlarged the strangely small bright view of a girl .
What would experience give her after all , except a kind of ridiculous formal balance , like that of a drilled dog in the street ?
`` What 's so detestable in this country , '' she exclaimed , `` is the blue -- always blue sky and blue sea .
It 's like a curtain -- all the things one wants are on the other side of that .
I want to know what 's going on behind it .
I hate these divisions , do n't you , Terence ?
I shall never see them again .
Just by going on a ship we cut ourselves off entirely from the rest of the world .
I want to see England there -- London there -- all sorts of people -- why should n't one ?
why should one be shut up all by oneself in a room ? ''
`` I do n't satisfy you in the way you satisfy me , '' he continued .
This being so , she joined in the world 's conspiracy to consider them for the time incapacitated from the business of life , struck by their intensity of feeling into enmity against life , and almost succeeded in dismissing them from her thoughts .
`` Well , we must make the best of it , '' Helen replied philosophically .
They had only just time to get her into bed and call a doctor before she died .
She reminded him of Gibbon ; she had the first volume somewhere still ; if he were undertaking the education of Evelyn , that surely was the test ; or she had heard that Burke , upon the American Rebellion -- Evelyn ought to read them both simultaneously .
One night while we were away that old numskull Thornbury was doddering about the passages very late .
He saw the Signora Lola Mendoza , as she calls herself , cross the passage in her nightgown .
He communicated his suspicions next morning to Elliot , with the result that Rodriguez went to the woman and gave her twenty-four hours in which to clear out of the place .
No one seems to have enquired into the truth of the story , or to have asked Thornbury and Elliot what business it was of theirs ; they had it entirely their own way .
Hewet remarked that there could be no doubt as to the lady 's profession .
`` I quite agree with you , St. John , '' Helen burst out .
A man who 's made a fortune in trade as Mr. Thornbury has is bound to be twice as bad as any prostitute . ''
The argument led to some profoundly gloomy statements of a general nature .
Who were they , after all -- what authority had they -- what power against the mass of superstition and ignorance ?
Directly you met an English person , of the middle classes , you were conscious of an indefinable sensation of loathing ; directly you saw the brown crescent of houses above Dover , the same thing came over you .
But unfortunately St. John added , you could n't trust these foreigners --
I have n't been listening , because I 've been looking at you .
You looked very beautiful ; I wish you 'd go on sitting for ever . ''
Was she sad , or was she really laughing ?
`` That is what I find so difficult , saying something different about everybody . ''
Then she thought that she had said enough about herself , and she asked whether they had come down to join the tennis tournament .
They were both a little touched by the sight of her remembering how lately they had been listening to evil words about her , and Terence asked her what her scheme was , and she explained that she was going to found a club -- a club for doing things , really doing them .
She became very animated , as she talked on and on , for she professed herself certain that if once twenty people -- no , ten would be enough if they were keen -- set about doing things instead of talking about doing them , they could abolish almost every evil that exists .
There were three reasons , and they were very good ones , he said .
As for himself , when he went to a party , as one was sometimes obliged to , from a wish not to give offence -- his niece , for example , had been married the other day -- he walked into the middle of the room , said `` Ha !
She was going to give a party directly she got back , and they were all to be invited , and she should set people to watch Mr. Pepper , and if she heard that he had been caught saying `` Ha !
He consulted the sheet pinned to the door .
`` We ca n't go on like this , Terence .
Either you 've got to find another doctor , or you must tell Rodriguez to stop coming , and I 'll manage for myself .
It 's no use for him to say that Rachel 's better ; she 's not better ; she 's worse . ''
`` It is not serious , I assure you .
He had not seen her yesterday .
She made no objection , and went and sat at a table in the window .
Why does n't he come ? ''
He was appalled to think of the dirty little man downstairs in connection with illness like this , and turning instinctively to Helen , but she was doing something at a table in the window , and did not seem to realise how great the shock to him must be .
He rose to go , for he could not endure to listen any longer ; his heart beat quickly and painfully with anger and misery .
`` Of course there 's another doctor , and , if there is n't , you 've got to find one .
I 'm going down to saddle the horse . ''
Terence went upstairs , stood inside the door to take Helen 's directions , looked over at Rachel , but did not attempt to speak to her .
She appeared vaguely conscious of his presence , but it seemed to disturb her , and she turned , so that she lay with her back to him .
Oh , it was absurd , when one thought of it , to sit here in a little room suffering and caring .
Rachel , a tiny creature , lay ill beneath him , and here in his little room he suffered on her account .
The nearness of their bodies in this vast universe , and the minuteness of their bodies , seemed to him absurd and laughable .
He leant on the window-sill , thinking , until he almost forgot the time and the place .
To Terence 's demand , `` She seems to be better ? ''
Peor and Baalim Forsake their Temples dim , With that twice batter 'd God of Palestine And mooned Astaroth --
But they prevented him , and pushed him down the passage and into a bedroom far from her room .
She paused and looked out over the slope of the hill at the Ambroses ' villa ; the windows were blazing in the sun , and she thought how the soul of the dead had passed from those windows .
Having noticed that her eyes were red , and guessing the reason , the others took pains to keep up an elaborate conversation between themselves .
When you think what a nice girl she was -- only just engaged , and this need never have happened -- it seems too tragic . ''
She looked at Arthur as though he might be able to help her with something more suitable .
As they left the room it happened that Mrs. Paley 's wheeled chair ran into the Elliots , who were coming through the door , as she was going out .
I think you 're quite one of the nicest people I 've ever known , and one of the finest too .
For the moment she honestly desired that he should say no .
`` You see , I 'm not as simple as most women , '' Evelyn continued .
`` Something struck , '' said a man 's voice .
`` Impossible , '' St. John repeated .
He lay back in his chair , half-seeing the others , half-hearing what they said .
He was terribly tired , and the light and warmth , the movements of the hands , and the soft communicative voices soothed him ; they gave him a strange sense of quiet and relief .
The movements and the voices seemed to draw together from different parts of the room , and to combine themselves into a pattern before his eyes ; he was content to sit silently watching the pattern build itself up , looking at what he hardly saw .
