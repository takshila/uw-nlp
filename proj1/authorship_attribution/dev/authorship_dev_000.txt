If I could catch another one -- but that is hopeless ; it is a new variety , and the only sample ; this is plain .
I pity the poor noisy little animal , but there is nothing I can do to make it happy .
If I could tame it -- but that is out of the question ; the more I try , the worse I seem to make it .
It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore , to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues .
These works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages , are all fig-leaved now .
Yes , every one of them .
Mighty banquets were planned in his honor .
We got here yesterday -- will leave at noon to-day .
Yesterday , I had many things to do , but Bixby and I got with the pilots of two other boats and went off dissipating on a ten dollar dinner at a French restaurant breathe it not unto Ma !
-- where we ate sheep-head , fish with mushrooms , shrimps and oysters -- birds -- coffee with brandy burnt in it , & c & c , -- ate , drank and smoked , from 2 p.m. until 5 o'clock , and then -- then the day was too far gone to do any thing .
Therefore , I must answer right away , else I may leave town without doing it at all .
What in thunder are pilot 's wages to me ?
I never have once thought of returning home to go on the river again , and I never expect to do any more piloting at any price .
My livelihood must be made in this country -- and if I have to wait longer than I expected , let it be so -- I have no fear of failure .
I did think for awhile of going home this fall -- but when I found that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling aspiration every year , of these old care-worn Californians for twelve weary years -- I felt a little uncomfortable , but I stole a march on Disappointment and said I would not go home this fall .
I will spend the winter in San Francisco , if possible .
This country suits me , and -- it shall suit me , whether or no ... .
... with a gill of water a day to each man .
I got the whole story from the third mate and two of the sailors .
If my account gets to the Sacramento Union first , it will be published first all over the United States , France , England , Russia and Germany -- all over the world ; I may say .
You will see it .
You know how I appreciate that kind of thing -- especially from such a man , who is acknowledged to have no superior in the diplomatic circles of the world , and obtained from China concessions in favor of America which were refused to Sir Frederick Bruce and Envoys of France and Russia until procured for them by Burlingame himself -- which service was duly acknowledged by those dignitaries .
Of his descriptive news letters there were about twenty , and they were regarded by the readers of the Union as distinctly notable .
Re-reading those old letters to-day it is not altogether easy to understand why .
New York Tribune Bureau , Washington , will find me , without fail .
We shall reach Aspinwall Thursday morning at 6 o'clock , and San Francisco less than two weeks later .
I hope your booksellers will sell a hundred thousand copies of your travels . ''
But I will send her some , soon .
Steve Gillis , who sent a copy of his letter to the writer , added : `` Dick Stoker -- dear , gentle unselfish old Dick-died over three years ago , aged 78 .
I am sure it will be a melancholy pleasure to Mark to know that Dick lived in comfort all his later life , sincerely loved and respected by all who knew him .
To Dr. John Brown , in Edinburgh :
and Mrs. Twichell , in Hartford :
A photographer came up the other day and wanted to make some views , and I shall send you the result per this mail .
4. , but there are some things more which I am powerfully moved to write .
We always have a rattling good time at the Club and we do want you to come , ever so much .
Mrs. Clemens and I are persuading ourselves that you twain will come .
You see , part of that is true .
When I observed that my `` Sketches '' had dropped from a sale of 6 or 7000 a month down to 1200 a month , I said `` this ai n't no time to be publishing books ; therefore , let Tom lie still till Autumn , Mr. Bliss , and make a holiday book of him to beguile the young people withal . ''
Well , I could not go , but gave them counsel and advice by letter , and in the kindliest terms as to the raising of the flag -- advised them `` not to raise it . ''
I am out of all patience with Harte for selling it .
Clemens had great admiration for Harte 's ability and believed that between them they could turn out a successful play .
Whether or not this belief was justified will appear later .
`` There 's success for you , '' he said ; `` it makes me despair of the Republic . ''
Day after tomorrow we leave for the hills beyond Elmira , N. Y. for the summer , when I shall hope to write a book of some sort or other to beat the people with .
He says there is a large class of the young , in schools and seminaries who -- But you let him tell you .
He has ciphered it all down to a demonstration .
The walk to and from that place gives me what exercise I need , and all I take .
Livy and Miss Spaulding are studying drawing and German , and the children have a German day-governess .
I can not see but that the children speak German as well as they do English .
I can not work and study German at the same time : so I have dropped the latter , and do not even read the language , except in the morning paper to get the news .
I wonder what the secret of it is .
-- October days , let us get up at dawn and breakfast at the tower .
Well , we are all getting along here first-rate ; Livy gains strength daily , and sits up a deal ; the baby is five weeks old and -- but no more of this ; somebody may be reading this letter 80 years hence .
And so , my friend ( you pitying snob , I mean , who are holding this yellow paper in your hand in 1960 , ) save yourself the trouble of looking further ; I know how pathetically trivial our small concerns will seem to you , and I will not let your eye profane them .
No , I keep my news ; you keep your compassion .
I wrote 4000 words to-day and I touch 3000 and upwards pretty often , and do n't fall below 1600 any working day .
I have finished one small book , and am away along in a big 433 one that I half-finished two or three years ago .
They did not put in the entire month of October as they had planned , but they did put in a portion of that month , the latter half , working out their old idea .
Franklin spoke positively of the frequent spreeing .

`` Yes , that is the trouble , '' assented the foreman .
DEAR HOWELLS , -- I came on from Elmira a day or two ago , where I left a house of mourning .
Mr. Crane died , after ten months of pain and two whole days of dying , at the farm on the hill , the 3rd inst : A man who had always hoped for a swift death .
Mrs. Crane and Mrs. Clemens and the children were in a gloom which brought back to me the days of nineteen years ago , when Mr. Langdon died .
Many a time , in the past ten days , the sight of her has reminded me , with a pang , of the desolation which uttered itself in the closing sentence of your last letter to me .
Your telegram reached me in Lyons last night and was very pleasant news indeed .
To Mrs. Clemens , in Ouchy , Switzerland :
After writing this present letter I was feeling blue about Huck Finn , but I sat down and overhauled your reports from now back to last April and compared them with the splendid Oct.-Nov. business , and went to bed feeling refreshed and fine , for certainly it has been a handsome year .
DEAR SUE , -- We are getting wonted .
The open fires have driven away the cold and the doubt , and now a cheery spirit pervades the place .
Livy and the Kings and Mademoiselle having been taking their tea a number of times , lately , on the open terrace with the city and the hills and the sunset for company .
I stop work , a few minutes , as a rule , when the sun gets down to the hilltops west of Florence , and join the tea-group to wonder and exclaim .
There is always some new miracle in the view , a new and exquisite variation in the show , a variation which occurs every 15 minutes between dawn and night .
Once early in the morning , a multitude of white villas not before perceived , revealed themselves on the far hills ; then we recognized that all those great hills are snowed thick with them , clear to the summit .

I suppose it was all really taken out of me in Berlin .
I never fully laid Webster 's disastrous condition before Mr. Rogers until to-night after billiards .
We discussed it from various standpoints , and found it a sufficiently difficult problem to solve ; but he thinks that after he has slept upon it and thought it over he will know what to suggest .
There is danger that she must retire from the struggle for a College degree for lack of support for herself and for Miss Sullivan , ( the teacher who has been with her from the start -- Mr. Rogers will remember her . )
Nothing but the strictest hiding can enable me to write my long book in time .
I had known one of them in London 24 years ago .
How charming they were -- in spirit , manner , language , pronunciation , enunciation , grammar , phrasing , matter , carriage , clothes -- in every detail that goes to make the real lady and gentleman , and welcome guest .
It was a triumph .
Arduous and painstaking cultivation has not diminished or artificialized their music , but on the contrary -- to my surprise -- has mightily reinforced its eloquence and beauty .
Away back in the beginning -- to my mind -- their music made all other vocal music cheap ; and that early notion is emphasized now .
Joe , ten pages of Mrs. Cheney 's masterly biography of her fathers -- no , five pages of it -- contain more meat , more sense , more literature , more brilliancy , than that whole basketful of drowsy rubbish put together .
Why , in that dead atmosphere even Brooks himself is dull -- he wearied me ; oh how he wearied me !
By the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country , and there can be no male Member but myself .
Some day I may admit males , but I do n't know -- they are capricious and inharmonious , and their ways provoke me a good deal .

DEAR SIR , -- I desire to make a complaint , and I bring it to you , the head of the company , because by experience I know better than to carry it to a subordinate .
He was no longer radical ; he had become eclectic .
It is a good deal of a concession that he makes to Twichell , after those earlier letters from Sweden , in which osteopathy had been heralded as the anodyne for all human ills .

21 FIFTH AVE. Sunday Morning .
I was tired , discouraged , white with alkali dust , and did not know anybody ; and if you had said then , `` Cheer up , desolate stranger , don't be down-hearted -- pass on , and come again in 1905 , '' you can not think how grateful I would have been and how gladly I would have closed the contract .
Although I was not expecting to be invited , I was watching out for it , and was hurt and disappointed when you started to ask me and changed it to , `` How soon are you going away ? ''
At dinner shortly after he produced from his pocket a slip of paper on which he had set down what he said was `` his only poem . ''
The idea of your house going to the wanton expense of a flower garden !
-- are n't you enough ?
Now then you want to reform -- dear -- and do right .
The idea of writing to me would have had to wait a long time if it waited until your brain originated it .
It was born of an outside suggestion -- Sir Thomas and my old Captain .
DEAR MRS. HOOKWAY , -- Although I am full of the spirit of work this morning , a rarity with me lately -- I must steal a moment or two for a word in person : for I have been reading the eloquent account in the Record-Herald and am pleasurably stirred , to my deepest deeps .
And it supports and re-affirms what I have so often and strenuously said in public that a children 's theatre is easily the most valuable adjunct that any educational institution for the young can have , and that no otherwise good school is complete without it .
New York was sixty miles away and he did not often care to make the journey .
He did not complain .
`` It 's wonderfully ingenious , Colonel , it 's ever so clever and interesting -- why , I could play with it all day .
What are you going to do with it ? ''
I do n't quite make out which window you -- ''
Yes , it 's a matter of ashes .
It can no doubt be easily shown that the colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress , and that that part is vast ; but that the material progress has been immeasurably vaster , I think you will concede .
Of course there are exceptions -- like Professor Henry of Princeton , the inventor of Mr. Morse 's system of telegraphy -- but these exceptions are few .
We think we see what these inventors have done : no , we see only the visible vast frontage of their work ; behind it is their far vaster work , and it is invisible to the careless glance .
What constitutes the population of a land ?
Shall a million ounces of brass and a million ounces of gold be held to be of the same value ?
By this standard of measurement , this nation , two or three generations ago , consisted of mere cripples , paralytics , dead men , as compared with the men of to-day .
Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech began , notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd 's terms ; but he lost no time in pulling himself out again , and so by the time the speech was finished his valves were open once more , and he was forcing himself to accept without resentment the common herd 's frank fashion of dropping sociably into other people 's conversations unembarrassed and uninvited .
Theoretically Barrow was his equal , but it was distinctly distasteful to see him exhibit it .
`` Yes , '' Barrow said , `` that is the thing for you to do -- if you can . ''
has he got a secret of his birth ? ''
`` He 's straining his viscera and he 's breaking his heart trying to get some low-down job that a good dog would n't have , and yet wants to let on that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he would n't do it .
He 's not responsible . ''
`` Oh , miserable me ! ''
I never thought of such a thing . ''
They hurried softly down and peeped in .
Sellers whispered , in a sort of despair --
Is it on account of the color , or the form ? ''
Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat , but it was an error .
It vexed him to think that this Englishman , with the traveling Briton 's everlasting disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample-grains of sand , would jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as himself -- generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at her poorest , there being nothing at that table to inspire her , give her a start , keep her from going to sleep .
There would be a different result another time , he judged .
And it is n't any better here in the Hall of Audience .
`` I 'm coming to like him , Hawkins .
Yes , I 'm all admiration for him , on account of his character , and liking naturally follows admiration , you know .
I 'm coming to like him immensely .
In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks .
But Sellers liked it .
He said it was just himself all over -- a portrait that sweated moods from every pore , and no two moods alike .
Next he tried the velvet collar , and smiled a smile of such contentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing about an overcoat .
But he was treading on dangerous ground , now .
He began to come across solid wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach ; and occasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth ; it was getting to be perilous times with him , but he held his grip with good courage and hopefully , till at last he began to stumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity .
I went and pulled the manuscript out of his mouth , and found that the sensitive creature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact that I ever laid before a trusting public .
-- the voices of the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the evening air , while our train , with its great , glaring Polyphemus eye , lighting up long vistas of prairie , rushed into the night and the Wild .
Then a fainter groan , and another blow , and away sped the stage into the darkness , and left the grisly mystery behind us . ]
Slade resented them promptly .
The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears , prayers and lamentations , that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal beam .
Oh , my dear wife ! ''
The Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if `` history , '' much of it relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has possibly never heard of ; and who inhabited a country which is not set down in the geography .
These was a King with the remarkable name of Coriantumr , and he warred with Shared , and Lib , and Shiz , and others , in the `` plains of Heshlon '' ; and the `` valley of Gilgal '' ; and the `` wilderness of Akish '' ; and the `` land of Moran '' ; and the `` plains of Agosh '' ; and `` Ogath , '' and `` Ramah , '' and the `` land of Corihor , '' and the `` hill Comnor , '' by `` the waters of Ripliancum , '' etc.
`` And it came to pass , '' after a deal of fighting , that Coriantumr , upon making calculation of his losses , found that `` there had been slain two millions of mighty men , and also their wives and their children '' -- say 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 in all -- '' and he began to sorrow in his heart . ''
Shiz declined , except upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head off first -- a thing which Coriantumr would not do .
Then there was more fighting for a season ; then four years were devoted to gathering the forces for a final struggle -- after which ensued a battle , which , I take it , is the most remarkable set forth in history , -- except , perhaps , that of the Kilkenny cats , which it resembles in some respects .
Still , there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting to new comers ; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things strange to the upper air -- things living and dead , that flitted hither and thither , going and coming , appearing and disappearing among the rolling billows of dust -- hats , chickens and parasols sailing in the remote heavens ; blankets , tin signs , sage-brush and shingles a shade lower ; door-mats and buffalo robes lower still ; shovels and coal scuttles on the next grade ; glass doors , cats and little children on the next ; disrupted lumber yards , light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next ; and down only thirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating roofs and vacant lots .
`` And sold ! ''
said the auctioneer , and passed over the Genuine Mexican Plug to me .
Still , I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him , my idea being to get him crippled , and throw him on the borrower 's hands , or killed , and make the borrower pay for him .
But somehow nothing ever happened to him .
Sometimes he miscalculated a little , and did not get his rider through intact , but he always got through himself .
Of course I had tried to sell him ; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met with little sympathy .
But holders were stiff , and we retired from the market again .
I never tried to ride the horse any more .
Walking was good enough exercise for a man like me , that had nothing the matter with him except ruptures , internal injuries , and such things .
As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of the `` Brigade . ''
A stone whizzed by my head .
I flattened myself out in the dust like a postage stamp , and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little he would probably hear another noise .
In my heart , now , I execrated secret expeditions .
I promised myself that this should be my last , though the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins .
The sea was running high and the storm increasing .
When we had pulled a mile , laboriously , we were evidently in serious peril , for the storm had greatly augmented ; the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests , the heavens were hung with black , and the wind blew with great fury .
It was hard work to do this , she plunged so , and so beat and belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows .
And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver 's hand .
The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by murdered men .
That was the very expression used .
The caution was not without fruit .
The jury was a unit -- the verdict .
We expected great things of the Occidental .
She also introduced a young French Duke of aggravated refinement , in love with the blonde .
He also introduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant , put him on a salary and set him on the midnight track of the Duke with a poisoned dagger .
He also created an Irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed him in the service of the society-young-lady with an ulterior mission to carry billet-doux to the Duke .
At ten o'clock at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his glory .
In every little cooped-up , dingy cavern of a hut , faint with the odor of burning Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly , guttering tallow candle , were two or three yellow , long-tailed vagabonds , coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed , smoking opium , motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess of satisfaction -- or rather the recent smoker looks thus , immediately after having passed the pipe to his neighbor -- for opium-smoking is a comfortless operation , and requires constant attention .
A lamp sits on the bed , the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker's mouth ; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire , sets it on fire , and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a hole with putty ; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds to smoke -- and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue .
There is a transition for you !
And some of us have swept around snow-walled curves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity , six thousand feet above the sea , and looked down as the birds do , upon the deathless Summer of the Sacramento Valley , with its fruitful fields , its feathery foliage , its silver streams , all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted atmosphere , and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance -- a dreamy , exquisite glimpse of fairyland , made all the more charming and striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow , and savage crags and precipices .
He paused in the door , with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face , and contemplated the daring reptile in the corner .
Moving among the stirring crowds , you come to the poi merchants , squatting in the shade on their hams , in true native fashion , and surrounded by purchasers .
The poi looks like common flour paste , and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd , and capable of holding from one to three or four gallons .
I 'm no official .
He remained at the door a half hour , and occasionally gave an order to the men who were erecting the kahilis [ Ranks of long-handled mops made of gaudy feathers -- sacred to royalty .
This feeble personage had crape enough around his hat to express the grief of an entire nation , and as usual he neglected no opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of the simple Kanakas .
noble ambition of this modern Richelieu !
Presently something galloped over me once more .
They were grating their teeth like tobacco worms , and appeared to be dissatisfied about something .
But a rat came and bothered me , and shortly afterward a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair .
Then conviction came like a revelation -- the superstitions of a hundred generations passed from before the people like a cloud , and a shout went up , `` the tabu is broken !
Now this whole thing was a practical joke , and the robbers were personal friends of ours in disguise , and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the whole operation , listening .
To all these were such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians .
The sensation of being at work again was luxurious , and I wrought all the week with unflagging pleasure .
We went to press , and I waited a day with some solicitude to see whether my effort was going to attract any notice .
As I left the office , towards sundown , a group of men and boys at the foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse , and gave me passageway , and I heard one or two of them say , `` That 's him ! ''
I was naturally pleased by this incident .
The group separated and fell back as I approached , and I heard a man say , `` Look at his eye ! ''
I pretended not to observe the notice I was attracting , but secretly I was pleased with it , and was purposing to write an account of it to my aunt .
I went up the short flight of stairs , and heard cheery voices and a ringing laugh as I drew near the door , which I opened , and caught a glimpse of two young rural-looking men , whose faces blanched and lengthened when they saw me , and then they both plunged through the window with a great crash .
There was about an average of two dogs to one man ; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them , and then they went for it by brigades and divisions , with a rush , and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails , and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time ; but that was no matter , for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest anyway ; the men rose , sometimes , to observe it the better and bet on it , and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object ; and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time .
In the end , the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws , and proceeded to growl over it , and gnaw it , and grease the floor with it , just as fifty others were already doing ; and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments .
There was n't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle .
There was no gas , there were no candles ; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light .
You ca n't resurrect a dead nation without it ; there is n't any way .
So I wanted to sample things , and be finding out what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when I should come to need it .
Again they were all unhit -- at first .
But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again ; and state it slowly , so it could soak into his understanding .
I did it ; and after a little he had the idea , and he brought his fist down and said _he_ did n't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way ; and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes .
Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them , and asked them why they did that despite to the shield .
`` But , your Highness , suppose he has nothing to confess ? ''
`` You know of me ? ''
I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and among neighboring castles , and with her permission I would like to examine her collection , her bric-a-brac -- that is to say , her prisoners .
This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age , apparently ; but only apparently ; she had been there nine years , and was eighteen when she entered .
The young husband had interfered at that point , believing the bride 's life in danger , and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests , in the parlor , and left him there astonished at this strange treatment , and implacably embittered against both bride and groom .
The said lord being cramped for dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals , and here in her bastile they had been ever since ; hither , indeed , they had come before their crime was an hour old , and had never seen each other since .
Here they were , kenneled like toads in the same rock ; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other , yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not .
`` Is she alive ? ''
`` Well , well , well , -- now who would ever have thought it ?
No sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation .
You 're rich -- yes , -- suddenly rich -- for about a day , maybe a week ; then somebody corners the market on _you_ , and down goes your bucket-shop ; ai n't that so , Sandy ? ''
It unfits you to argue about business , and you 're wrong to be always trying .
However , that aside , it was a good haul , anyway , and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur's court .
The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day , under this same old Established Church , which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise .
Sir , it is parlous news I bring , and -- be these pilgrims ?
I would utter it if it was Welsh . ''
Our Arthur the king -- ''
It was delicious to see a newspaper again , yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head-lines .
`` What , goodman , what ! ''
`` Would they be a week , think you -- and the matter so simple ?
I always use that high style when I 'm climaxing an effect .
Well , it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard .
`` He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring .
It belongeth to the king of the Demons of the Sea .
`` Sir Gaheris , and Sir Gareth -- both ! ''
He also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us , and had driven some cattle across our lines , but that the knights themselves had not come very near .
That was what I had been expecting .
They would grow bolder in the night , perhaps .
I mentioned it to Clarence .
Then , to business .
These early birds came scattering along after each other , about one every five minutes in our vicinity , during half an hour .
`` Ca n't , Mars Tom .
She say she spec ' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash , an ' so she tole me go 'long an ' 'tend to my own business -- she 'lowed SHE 'D 'tend to de whitewashin ' . ''
for they shall -- for they shall -- a -- a -- shall mourn -- a -- a -- blessed are they that shall -- they that -- a -- they that shall mourn , for they shall -- a -- shall WHAT ?
-- what do you want to be so mean for ? ''
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer , he only endured it -- if he even did that much .
As indeed it was ; for as sorely as Tom 's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on .
`` Why , yes , everybody that 's in love with each other .
Do you remember what I wrote on the slate ? ''
`` A body ca n't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people , Tom . ''
`` Why , you two was scuffling , and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat ; and then up you come , all reeling and staggering like , and snatched the knife and jammed it into him , just as he fetched you another awful clip -- and here you 've laid , as dead as a wedge til now . ''
THE two boys flew on and on , toward the village , speechless with horror .
Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy , and made them catch their breath ; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village , the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet .
`` Oh , Injun Joe , you promised me you 'd never -- ''
So Jackson's Island was chosen .
Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn , and he joined them promptly , for all careers were one to him ; he was indifferent .
Each would bring hooks and lines , and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way -- as became outlaws .
All who got this vague hint were cautioned to `` be mum and wait . ''
`` It 's NUTS ! ''
He had finished gouging out a cob , and now he fitted a weed stem to it , loaded it with tobacco , and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke -- he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment .
The other pirates envied him this majestic vice , and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly .
Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other 's arms and had a good , consoling cry , and then parted .
Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart .
So the talk ran on .
But presently it began to flag a trifle , and grow disjointed .
Every pore inside the boys ' cheeks became a spouting fountain ; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation ; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do , and sudden retchings followed every time .
Both boys were looking very pale and miserable , now .
Joe 's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers .
The children left for school , and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom 's marvellous dream .
So they swore again with dread solemnities .

Look at pap and my mother .

-- anybody would suspicion us that saw us . ''
Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand .
The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour .
However , this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory .
When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream , nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft .
It was the meanest kind of luck !
and blazed away at the place where the rustling was .
They fired a shot apiece as they started , but their bullets whizzed by and did n't do us any harm .
They got a posse together , and went off to guard the river bank , and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods .
They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave , but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks , and yet it was plain that this could not be , for their candles were not gone yet .
A long time after this -- they could not tell how long -- Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water -- they must find a spring .
She was surprised to hear Tom dissent .
They sat down , and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay .
Thought was soon busy ; nothing was said for some time .
Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could , but said he could not see to the end of the rift .
He proposed to explore .
Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom .
He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave .
When Becky told her father , in strict confidence , how Tom had taken her whipping at school , the Judge was visibly moved ; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own , the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble , a generous , a magnanimous lie -- a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington 's lauded Truth about the hatchet !
She went straight off and told Tom about it .
How true were his words , and how wise !
But what is Mr. Collins ' explanation .
On no other supposition is it possible to explain the attraction which the law evidently had for him , and his minute and undeviating accuracy in a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and ostentatious display of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping himself from tripping . ''
We can not afford to let that calamity come upon us .
When you say that I `` retort by calling France a nation of bastards , '' it is an error .
And not a small one , but a large one .
I made no such remark , nor anything resembling it .
Moreover , the magazine would not have allowed me to use so gross a word as that .
And so , at last , with a heavy heart , the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her , and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants .
`` And if that I could clothe me once , sweet sir , as thou art clad -- just once -- ''
In sooth I am no lord , but only poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city .
Prithee let me see the prince , and he will of his grace restore to me my rags , and let me hence unhurt .
Oh , be thou merciful , and save me ! ''
`` Explain , thou limb of Satan , or thy time is come ! ''
roared the man of war , and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue , for the instant , for fright and surprise .
`` Where is the boy ? ''
`` It is a secret -- mark thou reveal it not .
Why will you waste the precious time ?
All knew that a further delay must follow , for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony ; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in their stately robes .
Whoso touches him perils his life ! ''
I saw it in a dozen faces after church .
The girl was silent awhile , and sat dreamily gnawing a candle-end , apparently trying to think the thing out .
At last she gave her head a little toss and spoke out her opinion with decision :
It has its start , you see , and it is a phenomenally good one .
Moreover , it is latterly spreading with a constantly accelerating swiftness .
It has a better chance to grow and prosper and achieve permanency than any other existing 'ism ; ' for it has more to offer than any other .
Next , there must be money -- and plenty of it .
Among other witnesses , there is one who had a 'jumping toothache , ' which several times tempted her to 'believe that there was sensation in matter , but each time it was overcome by the power of Truth . '
And to this day she thinks it did n't , and I have not a doubt that she is nine-tenths right , and that her Christian Science faith did her better service than she could have gotten out of cocaine .
I can believe this , because my own case was somewhat similar , as per my former article .

I did not give the banquet .

Still , I make out pretty well , and should not complain .
This getting up the mast is no easy matter at any time with the sea we have , and is very exhausting in our present state .
Heading her up , however , makes the boat ship seas and keeps us all wet ; however , it can not be helped .
Our meal to-day for the fifteen consists of half a can of 'soup and boullie ' ; the other half is reserved for to-morrow .
Henry still keeps up grandly , and is a great favourite .
God grant he may be spared .
He lived eighteen days , and then stood up and stretched his neck and made a brave , weak effort to do his duty once more , and died in the act .
The table-fare was of the regulation pattern of the day : At 7 in the morning , a cup of bad coffee in bed ; at 9 , breakfast : bad coffee , with condensed milk ; soggy rolls , crackers , salt fish ; at 1 P.M. , luncheon : cold tongue , cold ham , cold corned beef , soggy cold rolls , crackers ; 5 P.M. , dinner : thick pea soup , salt fish , hot corned beef and sour kraut , boiled pork and beans , pudding ; 9 till 11 P.M. , supper : tea , with condensed milk , cold tongue , cold ham , pickles , sea-biscuit , pickled oysters , pickled pigs ' feet , grilled bones , golden buck .

There are two martyrdoms in the piece ; and they are curiously and sarcastically contrasted .
Civilisation tested at top and bottom both , you see .
'Well , that would be trimming it pretty fine , sure ! '
Nothing more was heard of the matter .
The galleries are crowded on this particular evening , for word has gone about that the Ausgleich is before the House ; that the President , Ritter von Abrahamowicz , has been throttling the Rules ; that the Opposition are in an inflammable state in consequence , and that the night session is likely to be of an exciting sort .
Twice a motion to adjourn had been offered -- a motion always in order in other Houses , and doubtless so in this one also .
The President had refused to put these motions .
By consequence , he was not in a pleasant place now , and was having a right hard time .
So he went on speaking .
Evidently the government 's mind was tottering when this bald insults to the House was the best way it could contrive for getting out of the frying-pan .
Then we formed in line of battle and marched four miles to a shady and pleasant piece of woods on the border of the far-reached expanses of a flowery prairie .
The Masons gave us a Missouri country breakfast , in Missourian abundance , and we needed it : hot biscuits ; hot 'wheat bread ' prettily criss-crossed in a lattice pattern on top ; hot corn pone ; fried chicken ; bacon , coffee , eggs , milk , buttermilk , etc .

We celebrated a lady 's birthday anniversary with toasts , speeches , a poem , and so forth .
The witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory , as witnesses always are .
The counsel were eloquent , argumentative , and vindictively abusive of each other , as was characteristic and proper .
The case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with an absurd decision and a ridiculous sentence .
I have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women ( for they are only human , and will expose their faces for the admiration of a Christian dog when no male Moor is by ) , and I am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness .
But we love the Old Travelers .
We can tell them the moment we see them .
Then they open their throttle valves , and how they do brag , and sneer , and swell , and soar , and blaspheme the sacred name of Truth !
Their central idea , their grand aim , is to subjugate you , keep you down , make you feel insignificant and humble in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glory !
But still I love the Old Travelers .
The main point of interest about the cathedral is the little Chapel of St. John the Baptist .
In this Chapel is a marble chest , in which , they told us , were the ashes of St. John ; and around it was wound a chain , which , they said , had confined him when he was in prison .
We did not desire to disbelieve these statements , and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct -- partly because we could have broken that chain , and so could St. John , and partly because we had seen St. John 's ashes before , in another church .
Toward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and the blue mountain peaks beyond .
But we were not caring for these things -- they did not interest us in the least .
We were in a fever of impatience ; we were dying to see the renowned cathedral !
We watched -- in this direction and that -- all around -- everywhere .
We needed no one to point it out -- we did not wish any one to point it out -- we would recognize it even in the desert of the great Sahara .
The guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was considered to have come from the hand of Phidias , since it was not possible that any other artist , of any epoch , could have copied nature with such faultless accuracy .
A skinned man would be likely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with some other matter .
It was a hideous thing , and yet there was a fascination about it some where .
There were Virgins and bishops there , above their natural size , made of solid silver , each worth , by weight , from eight hundred thousand to two millions of francs , and bearing gemmed books in their hands worth eighty thousand ; there were bas-reliefs that weighed six hundred pounds , carved in solid silver ; croziers and crosses , and candlesticks six and eight feet high , all of virgin gold , and brilliant with precious stones ; and beside these were all manner of cups and vases , and such things , rich in proportion .
It was an Aladdin 's palace .
If I could get the custody of them for a while , I fear me the market price of silver bishops would advance shortly , on account of their exceeding scarcity in the Cathedral of Milan .
Alack-a-day , the good Lord Luigi reigns not here in these sad times . ''

A stare from the guide .
I wish here to mention an inscription I have seen , before I forget it :
At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina , and so bright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them from the middle of a street we were traversing .
The city of Messina , milk-white , and starred and spangled all over with gaslights , was a fairy spectacle .
A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise , and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis .
And presently the Oracle stepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck like another Colossus of Rhodes .
It was a surprise to see him abroad at such an hour .
But what were sunsets to us , with the wild excitement upon us of approaching the most renowned of cities !
What cared we for outward visions , when Agamemnon , Achilles , and a thousand other heroes of the great Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies ?
We scorned to consider sunsets .
Do not know its name -- do not wish to know it -- want to go to bed .
However , it generally does give me the cholera to take a bath .
Then Grimes and his party rode away , and left the entire Christian family to be fined and as severely punished as the Mohammedan sheik should deem proper .
We asked `` Why ? ''
when he made his memorable entry into the city upon an ass .
The guide was perfectly serene .
Even the scattering groups of armed shepherds we met the afternoon before , tending their flocks of long-haired goats , were wanting here .
We saw but two living creatures .
At nine or ten in the morning we reached the Plain of the Shepherds , and stood in a walled garden of olives where the shepherds were watching their flocks by night , eighteen centuries ago , when the multitude of angels brought them the tidings that the Saviour was born .
In the huge Church of the Nativity , in Bethlehem , built fifteen hundred years ago by the inveterate St. Helena , they took us below ground , and into a grotto cut in the living rock .
This was the `` manger '' where Christ was born .
It is polished with the kisses of many generations of worshiping pilgrims .
The priests and the members of the Greek and Latin churches can not come by the same corridor to kneel in the sacred birthplace of the Redeemer , but are compelled to approach and retire by different avenues , lest they quarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth .
The lamp was a good one , but it revealed some disagreeable things -- a bed in the suburbs of a desert of room -- a bed that had hills and valleys in it , and you 'd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it by the man that slept there last , before you could lie comfortably ; a carpet that had seen better days ; a melancholy washstand in a remote corner , and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken nose ; a looking-glass split across the centre , which chopped your head off at the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished monster or other ; the paper peeling in shreds from the walls .
As I went about my peaceful business in the street , behold certain men set a dog on me , and --
`` Well , what of it ?

Grandpa Clemens was of the F.F.V 's of Virginia .
During the trip he reminded the little chap , every now and then , that he must be on his very best behavior there in Chicago .
Be very careful about this . ''
At the first breakfast which they ate in the Chicago clergyman 's house he heard his little son say in the meekest and most reverent way to the lady opposite him ,
Now just at this moment , a little bird , no bigger than a sparrow , flew along by and lit on a sage-bush about thirty yards away .

One bitter December night , Orion sat up reading until three o'clock in the morning and then , without looking at a clock , sallied forth to call on a young lady .
Anybody else would have regarded that as an indication of some kind or other and would have drawn inferences and gone home .
He merely walked in .
Orion had not asked for the young lady .
At last Orion got up and made some remark to the effect that probably the young lady was busy and he would go now and call again .
That was the old man 's chance , and he said with fervency `` Why good land , are n't you going to stop to breakfast ? ''

The home was made in the wee village of Florida , in Monroe county , and I was born there in 1835 .
The village contained a hundred people and I increased the population by one per cent .
There is no record of a person doing as much -- not even Shakespeare .
But I did it for Florida , and it shows that I could have done it for any place -- even London , I suppose .
Heretofore I have always stated that it was a palace , but I shall be more guarded , now .

This is probably another fussy superstition , like the European superstition that ice-water is unhealthy .
Fortunately the women were not included in the disaster , and so their graces and their beauty still have the enhancing help of delicate fabrics and varied and beautiful colors .
I remember those days of twenty-one years ago , and a certain pathos clings about them .
Susy , with her manifold young charms and her iridescent mind , was as lovely a bubble as any we made that day -- and as transitory .
I spun many yarns ; among others the tale of Jim Wolf and the Cats .
Learning that he had done something in a small way in literature , I offered to try to find a market for him in that line .
_From Susy 's Biography of Me._
At the end of a French duel the pair hug and kiss and cry , and praise each other 's valor ; then the surgeons make an examination and pick out the scratched one , and the other one helps him on to the litter and pays his fare ; and in return the scratched one treats to champagne and oysters in the evening , and then `` the incident is closed , '' as the French say .
It is all polite , and gracious , and pretty , and impressive .
At the end of an Austrian duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the other man , utters some phrases of courteous regret , then bids him good-by and goes his way , and that incident also is closed .
The French duellist is painstakingly protected from danger , by the rules of the game .
His antagonist 's weapon can not reach so far as his body ; if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow .
What I have said to Mrs. H. is true .
And when I was on the point of lathering those people for bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it almost squelched , I perceived with joy that the C. 's were indignant about the way that my performance had been received in Boston .
That position was that I had been irreverent beyond belief , beyond imagination .
Very well , I had accepted that as a fact for a year or two , and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever I thought of it -- which was not frequently , if I could help it .
Whenever I thought of it I wondered how I ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a thing .
Until Mrs. H.'s letter came , it had been a good twenty-five years since I had thought of that matter ; and when she said that the thing was funny I wondered if possibly she might be right .
At any rate , my curiosity was aroused , and I wrote to Boston and got the whole thing copied , as above set forth .
I did n't regard it as a vice , because he was a Scotchman , and Scotch whiskey to a Scotchman is as innocent as milk is to the rest of the human race .
In Clinton 's case it was a virtue , and not an economical one .
Twenty-four dollars a week would really have been riches to us if we had n't had to support that jug ; because of the jug we were always sailing pretty close to the wind , and any tardiness in the arrival of any part of our income was sure to cause us some inconvenience .
But if he had known me he would have known that I was no more capable of wronging him than he was of wronging me .
I responded with the same quiet decision as before ,
That is his price . ''
`` Frequent '' is a cautious word , in this author 's mouth ; the very cautiousness of it , the vagueness of it , provokes suspicion ; it makes one suspect that this frequency was more frequent than the mere common everyday kinds of frequency which one is in the habit of averaging up with the unassuming term `` frequent .

Shelley and Cornelia are the responsible persons , and we can not in honor and decency allow the cruelties which they practised upon the unoffending wife to be pushed aside in order to give us a chance to waste time and tears over six sentimental justifications of an offence which the six ca n't justify , nor even respectably assist in justifying .

The hour passed quickly away in lively talk , and when it was ended , the lonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began .

Roxana caught her breath with a spasm , and said :
The old man sat awhile plunged in thought ; then he looked up with a satisfied light in his eye , and said : `` That this assassin should have put the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as if he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle -- but not now .

Mardi-Gras is of course a relic of the French and Spanish occupation ; but I judge that the religious feature has been pretty well knocked out of it now .
His medieval business , supplemented by the monsters and the oddities , and the pleasant creatures from fairy-land , is finer to look at than the poor fantastic inventions and performances of the reveling rabble of the priest 's day , and serves quite as well , perhaps , to emphasize the day and admonish men that the grace-line between the worldly season and the holy one is reached .

These seemed insane tales ; but Feringhea said come and see -- and he took him to a grave and dug up a hundred bodies , and told him all the circumstances of the killings , and named the Thugs who had done the work .
Sleeman captured some of these Thugs and proceeded to examine them separately , and with proper precautions against collusion ; for he would not believe any Indian's unsupported word .

It is shut up in a lofty turreted wall ; the main body of it is divided into six parts by perfectly straight streets that are more than a hundred feet wide ; the blocks of houses exhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural quaintnesses , the straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty little balconies , pillared and highly ornamented , and other cunning and cozy and inviting perches and projections , and many of the fronts are curiously pictured by the brush , and the whole of them have the soft rich tint of strawberry ice-cream .

And I saw Table Bay , so named for its levelness .
I saw the Castle -- built by the Dutch East India Company three hundred years ago -- where the Commanding General lives ; I saw St. Simon's Bay , where the Admiral lives .
She continually excuses herself .
The habits and dress of the people have always been primitive , and their laws simple to puerility .
On account of the extreme scarcity of material , it was found necessary to require the Duke of Bethany postmaster-general , to pull stroke-oar in the navy and thus sit in the rear of a noble of lower degree namely , Viscount Canaan , lord-justice of the common pleas .
After piling up a vast and intensely interesting collection , the former difficulty supervened ; his great heart broke again ; he sold out his soul 's idol to the retired brewer who possessed the missing brick .
A. Nineteen , in June .
How do you account for that ?
This Man Rogers happened upon me and introduced himself at the town of -- -- - , in the South of England , where I stayed awhile .
I was very willing , for I thought he would notice the name of the great Oxford Street hatter in it , and respect me accordingly .
But he turned it about with a sort of grave compassion , pointed out two or three blemishes , and said that I , being so recently arrived , could not be expected to know where to supply myself .
Then he said , `` Pardon me , '' and proceeded to cut a neat circle of red tissue paper ; daintily notched the edges of it ; took the mucilage and pasted it in my hat so as to cover the manufacturer 's name .
Not to suit Cooper ; for the purpose of this whole scheme is to show off his prodigy , Deerslayer -- Hawkeye -- Long-Rifle -- Leather-Stocking -- Pathfinder -- Bumppo before the ladies .
Cooper was certainly not a master in the construction of dialogue .
In the Deerslayer story he lets Deerslayer talk the showiest kind of book-talk sometimes , and at other times the basest of base dialects .
For instance , when some one asks him if he has a sweetheart , and if so , where she abides , this is his majestic answer :
I am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim , but I recognized it .
But she will never see me , for they do not let me out of this shabby stable -- a foul and miserable place , with most two wrecks like myself for company .

Just as he finished them a hand grenade came down the stove-pipe , and the explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments .
Maybe if we scraped her and put her in the draft again -- ''
I dragged that poor sick man from his bed and brought him .
He looked at the child and said she was not dying .
Then he said the child 's cough was only caused by some trifling irritation or other in the throat .
So he gave her something that sent her into a spasm of coughing , and presently up came a little wood splinter or so .
It is seldom pleasant to tell on oneself , but some times it is a sort of relief to a man to make a confession .
I wish to unburden my mind now , and yet I almost believe that I am moved to do it more because I long to bring censure upon another man than because I desire to pour balm upon my wounded heart .
Oh , if I could only see him weep ! ''
I could never withstand distress .
I tried him with mild jokes , then with severe ones ; I dosed him with bad jokes and riddled him with good ones ; I fired old stale jokes into him , and peppered him fore and aft with red-hot new ones ; I warmed up to my work , and assaulted him on the right and left , in front and behind ; I fumed and sweated and charged and ranted till I was hoarse and sick and frantic and furious ; but I never moved him once -- I never started a smile or a tear !
Never mind the details .
The Patent Office won .
I waited two hours and a half , and then I was admitted to the First Lord of the Treasury .
Here was a master intellect ; here was the very man to succor the suffering heirs of dead and forgotten Fisher .
They came up from Florida with a rush -- a great tidal wave of Fishers freighted with the same old musty documents about the same immortal corn-fields of their ancestor .
`` That was spirited , I am willing to admit . ''
The scientists climbed up on these and examined and tested them in various ways .
They walked along them for a great distance , but found no end and no break in them .

In about two hours more Dominie Miggles sent into court to borrow a `` stake '' from a friend .
During the next three or four hours the other dominie and the other deacons sent into court for small loans .
The truth is , I have got my hero ( or heroine ) into such a particularly close place that I do not see how I am ever going to get him ( or her ) out of it again , and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole business , and leave that person to get out the best way that offers -- -or else stay there .
Knowing the Twins intimately , I feel that I am peculiarly well qualified for the task I have taken upon myself .

DELIVERED IN HARTFORD , AT A DINNER TO CORNELIUS WALFORD , OF LONDON
They say that a policeman found a drunken man lying on the ground , up a dark alley , entertaining himself with shouting , `` To hell with ! ''
`` To hell with ! ''
I did not doubt his word ; I could not question a single item in a statement so stamped with the earnestness of truth as his ; but its dreadful details overpowered me , and threw my thoughts into hopeless confusion .
I saw the conductor looking at me .
And yet I can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank 's grandfather .
What were your profits , during the past year , from any trade , business , or vocation , wherever carried on ?
It has its start , you see , and it is a phenomenally good one .
Moreover , it is latterly spreading with a constantly accelerating swiftness .
But I am not astonished , for from other sources I know what must have been his method of applying Christian Science .
If I am in the right , he watchfully and diligently diverted his mind from unhealthy channels and compelled it to travel in healthy ones .
I think his method was to keep saying , `` I am well !
Perfectly sound , perfectly well !
Four years ago I wrote the preceding chapters .
I was assured by the wise that Christian Science was a fleeting craze and would soon perish .
Facts are nothing to him , he has no use for such things ; he works wholly by inspiration .
`` We '' are Mrs. Eddy ; a funny little affectation .
She replaced it later with the more dignified third person .
They changed nothing , they built nothing , they left nothing behind them to remember them by , nothing to hold their disciples together , nothing to solidify their work and enable it to defy the assaults of time and the weather .
They made one fatal mistake ; they all made it , each in his turn : they failed to organize their forces , they failed to centralize their strength , they failed to provide a fresh Bible and a sure and perpetual cash income for business , and often they failed to provide a new and accepted Divine Personage to worship .
She will transmit hers .
The Holy Ghost reveals the massed spirit of the fused trinity ; this massed spirit is expressed in Divine Science , and is the Comforter ; Divine Science conveys to men the `` spiritual interpretation '' of the Saviour 's teachings .
My '84 edition of Science and Health contains one hundred and twenty thousand words -- just half as many as the New Testament .
We call it a person 's nature .
Therefore , if these things be true , mental-healing and Science-healing are separate and distinct processes , and no kinship exists between them .
They believe it is a Christianity that is in the New Testament ; that it has always been there , that in the drift of ages it was lost through disuse and neglect , and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men , turning the night of life into day , its terrors into myths , its lamentations into songs of emancipation and rejoicing .
`` Oh , it was well enough , but too mixed-up , seemed to me . ''
`` Well , now , how ever do you manage it ?
I do n't mind saying I 'm suffering to know . ''
`` Where is he ? ''
Mr. Wilson took the witness .
Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired , which disordered his aim and caused him to cut a chip off of Howard 's ear .
The judge took his time again , and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned .
Angelo now spoke out and said he was content with the satisfaction he had got , and if the judge -- but Luigi shut him roughly up , and asked him not to make an ass of himself ; adding :
He invited them in to take a nightcap , and Howard and the judge accepted , but the doctor said he would have to go and see how Angelo's principal wound was getting on .
`` I want to go myself , but as I am rather young yet , I also will wait , and march when the Paladin is sent for . ''
Then we asked him what he was going to answer when the King should require him to name his reward .
The Paladin had it all arranged in his head , and brought it out promptly :
It had that look to me .
Then the like of this must have happened before .

Those surprised men were dumb for a moment , and their faces flushed darkly ; then the spokesman said :

Chapter 8 Joan Persuades Her Inquisitors
`` Do you believe in God ? ''
`` There 's no doubt about it .
It 's a kind of copy of Joan 's own in miniature . ''
Noel was surprised at that , and glanced up quickly , as if to see if I was in earnest .
That is the way with us ; we may go on half of our life not knowing such a thing is in us , when in reality it was there all the time , and all we needed was something to turn up that would call for it .
Indeed , it was always so without family .
It is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed in that way .

He seemed to actually turn pale .
But he got no further .
`` Oh , my goodness ! ''
`` The worlds He has saved are like to the gates of heaven in number- -none can count them .

But here they take their right place , and Caesar and Napoleon and Alexander have to take a back seat .
The greatest military genius our world ever produced was a brick-layer from somewhere back of Boston -- died during the Revolution -- by the name of Absalom Jones .
Wherever he goes , crowds flock to see him .
But he never got a chance ; he tried heaps of times to enlist as a private , but he had lost both thumbs and a couple of front teeth , and the recruiting sergeant would n't pass him .
There goes another salute .

There are clauses which seem vague , other clauses which seem almost unnecessary , and still others which bear the flavor of `` surplusage , '' to speak in legal phrase .
We made a treaty with China in 1858 ; Mr. Burlingame 's new treaty is an addition to that one , and an amplification of its powers .
His Majesty , the Emperor of China , being of the opinion that in making concessions to the citizens or subjects of foreign Powers of the privilege of residing on certain tracts of land , or resorting to certain waters of that Empire for the purposes of trade , he has by no means relinquished his right of eminent domain or dominion over the said land and waters , hereby agrees that no such concession or grant shall be construed to give to any Power or party which may be at war with or hostile to the United States the right to attack the citizens of the United States or their property within the said lands or waters ; and the United States , for themselves , hereby agree to abstain from offensively attacking the citizens or subjects of any Power or party or their property with which they may be at war on any such tract of land or waters of the said Empire ; but nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the United States from resisting an attack by any hostile Power or party upon their citizens or their property .
It is further agreed that if any right or interest in any tract of land in China has been or shall hereafter be granted by the Government of China to the United States or their citizens for purposes of trade or commerce , that grant shall in no event be construed to divest the Chinese authorities of their right of jurisdiction over persons and property within said tract of land , except so far as that right may have been expressly relinquished by treaty .
The foreigners residing upon these tracts create courts of justice , organize police forces , and govern themselves by laws of their own framing .
These communities , through liberality of China , are so independent and so unshackled that they have all the seeming of colonies -- insomuch that the jurisdiction of China over them was in time lost sight of and disregarded -- at least , questioned .
, by way of payment to the Government of a stipulated rental .
Perhaps those Chinamen were as well governed as they have been anywhere in China , perhaps it was entirely just that they should pay for good government -- but the principle was wrong ; it was an encroachment upon the rights of the crown , and caused the Government uneasiness ; the boundary thus passed there was no telling how far the encroachment might be pushed .
The French have persistently claimed the right to exercise untrammeled jurisdiction over both natives and foreigners residing within their `` concessions , '' but the present Minister , Monsieur Moustier , has yielded this position in favor of the anti-concession doctrine , and thus have ignored the `` eminent dominion '' of the Chinese Government .
Under Article 1 of the new treaty , the question of whether an enemy of America can attack an American colony in China is answered in the negative .
Under it the right of the Chinese Government to regulate the governing , taxing , and trying of its subjects resident within American `` concessions '' is recognized -- in a word , its supreme control over its own people is recognized .
During a war between Russia and Denmark , a Prussian man-of-war captured two Danish vessels lying at harbor in a Chinese harbor or roadstead , and carried them off .
They beget and keep alive a `` distrust '' of foreigners among the Chinese people .
It will surprise many among us to know that the Chinese are eminently hospitable , by nature , toward strangers .
In time , had the Jesuits been let alone , they would have completely Christianized China , no doubt ; that is , they would have made of the Chinese , Christians according to their moral , physical , and intellectual strength , and then given Nature a few generations in which to shed the Pagan skin , and sap the Pagan blood , and so perfect the work .
For , be it known , one Jesuit missionary is equal to an army of any other denomination where there is actual work to be done , and solid , unsentimental wisdom to be exercised .
For these things they were driven out of the country .
The Emperor of China shall have the right to appoint consuls at ports of the United States , who shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those which are enjoyed by public law and treaty in the United States by the Consuls of Great Britain and Russia , or either of them .
The Consuls referred to above will be appointed with all convenient dispatch .
They will be Americans , but will in all cases be men who are capable of feeling pity for persecuted Chinamen , and will call to a strict account all who wrong them .
It affords me infinite satisfaction to call particular attention to this Consul clause , and think of the howl that will go up from the cooks , the railroad graders , and the cobble-stone artists of California , when they read it .
They can never beat and bang and set the dogs on the Chinamen any more .
In San Francisco , a large part of the most interesting local news in the daily papers consists of gorgeous compliments to the `` able and efficient '' Officer This and That for arresting Ah Foo , or Ching Wang , or Song Hi for stealing a chicken ; but when some white brute breaks an unoffending Chinaman 's head with a brick , the paper does not compliment any officer for arresting the assaulter , for the simple reason that the officer does not make the arrest ; the shedding of Chinese blood only makes him laugh ; he considers it fun of the most entertaining description .
The California laws do not allow Chinamen to testify against white men .
Article 8 looks entirely unnecessary at a first glance .
Until that is done , only the drippings ( they amount to millions annually ) of the vast fountains of Eastern wealth can be caught by the Western nations .
They want railways and telegraphs , but they fear to put these engines of power into the hands of strangers without a guaranty that they will not be used for their own oppression , possibly their destruction .
The superstitious people cried out that the white man 's mysterious machine had destroyed the `` good luck '' of the district .
The telegraph had to be taken down , otherwise the exasperated people would have done it themselves .
Their reason was exactly the same as that offered by the Chinese -- they said it would destroy the `` good luck '' of the country .
Animals graze upon the grass-clad graves ( for all things are made useful in China ) , and the spaces between are carefully and industriously cultivated .
The first railroad that plows its pitiless way through these myriads of sacred hillocks will carry dismay and distress into countless households .
With such encouragement from foreigners , and such guaranties of good will and just intent as Article 8 offers by simply agreeing that China may transact her own private business unmolested by meddlesome interference , the Emperor will cheerfully begin to open up his country with roads and telegraphs .
It seems a simple thing and an easy one to accord to a man such manifest and indisputable rights , but beyond all doubt this assurance is what China craves most .
Article 8 , indorsed by all the Western powers , would unlock the riches of 400,000,000 of Chinese subjects to the world .
The new treaty with America will tend to strengthen and encourage him in his design .
I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week .
Now I thought of something else .
The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake .
I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep .
When I woke up I did n't know where I was for a minute .
I set up and looked around , a little scared .
Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and SMELT late .
Well , I war n't long making him understand I war n't dead .
I was ever so glad to see Jim .
I war n't lonesome now .
I talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing .
`` Come , now , what 's your real name ? ''
`` Well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck .
We 'd GOT to find that boat now -- had to have it for ourselves .
No sign of a boat .
Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further -- so scared he had n't hardly any strength left , he said .
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars .
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he didn't want no more adventures .
`` Why , yes , dat 's so ; I -- I 'd done forgot it .
Bekase why : would a wise man want to live in de mids ' er sich a blim-blammin ' all de time ?
`` Blame de point !
En mine you , de REAL pint is down furder -- it 's down deeper .
It lays in de way Sollermun was raised .

No , he ai n't ; he ca n't 'ford it .

Is a Frenchman a man ? ''
But we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more .
Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog .
It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river .
It was just dark now .
I never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
Jim war n't on his island , so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country .
My souls , but I was scared !
A voice not twenty-five foot from me says :
`` But , Huck , dese kings o ' ourn is reglar rapscallions ; dat 's jist what dey is ; dey 's reglar rapscallions . ''
It jolted her up like everything , of course ; but I was over the shoal water now , so I went right along , her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time , and told her every blame thing , from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat , clear through to where she flung herself on to the king 's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times -- and then up she jumps , with her face afire like sunset , and says :
`` But what time o ' day ? ''
You do it pretty awkward . ''
`` Well , if that ai n't just like you , Huck Finn .
You CAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing .
No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound .
I wish there was a moat to this cabin .
`` Well , I tell you what I think .
What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger 's breakfast-time ?
But Tom said he would let me help him do it .
It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and did n't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we did n't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so Tom says :
`` Oh , there 's one thing I forgot .
Could you raise a flower here , do you reckon ? ''
So out he went , and down cellar went I .
Aunt Sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and I found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me .
-- what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan ' ?
Can you put yourself in the man 's place and tell me what he felt and what he thought ?
By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his family 's approval and a large share of his own ; but the public approval was more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together -- in the earth or above it ; to secure that would furnish him the MOST comfort of mind , the most SELF-approval ; so he sacrificed all other values to get it .
He relinquished a lucrative post and got mere food and lodging in place of it .
Your reform will never quite reach perfection , for your temper will beat you now and then , but you come near enough .
It takes fifty men a hundred years to invent it .
I use the word in that sense .
Watt noticed that confined steam was strong enough to lift the lid of the teapot .
And so there was a working engine .
There are no MATERIAL values ; there are only spiritual ones .
Can you extend that to money ?
You say the mind is wholly spiritual ; then you say `` I have a pain '' and find that this time the Me is mental AND spiritual combined .
We imagine a Master and King over what you call The Whole Thing , and we speak of him as `` I , '' but when we try to define him we find we can not do it .
Have you ever seen me uncheerful , unhappy .
From this Victoria Hotel one looks straight across a flat of trifling width to a lofty mountain barrier , which has a gateway in it shaped like an inverted pyramid .
The gateway , in the dark-colored barrier , makes a strong frame for the great picture .
`` Yes , I understand -- general jobbing -- little of everything -- anything that there 's money in . ''
I sat in the gloom and the deep stillness , waiting -- one minute , two minutes , I do not know exactly how long -- then the soft music of the hidden orchestra began to breathe its rich , long sighs out from under the distant stage , and by and by the drop-curtain parted in the middle and was drawn softly aside , disclosing the twilighted wood and a wayside shrine , with a white-robed girl praying and a man standing near .
The highest peaks of the Karakorum range .
He was full of surprised admiration ; said it was abnormal .
I said it was wonderful , while we were greasing up , but he said that when I came to know these steel spider-webs I would realize that nothing but dynamite could cripple them .
We got up a handsome speed , and presently traversed a brick , and I went out over the top of the tiller and landed , head down , on the instructor 's back , and saw the machine fluttering in the air between me and the sun .
It was well it came down on us , for that broke the fall , and it was not injured .
But it is only surmise ; there is no EVIDENCE that he ever did either of those things .
From Chapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED .
So it has happened that the `` old timers '' who went to school with Mark or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to have been indicative of what was to come .
With some seventy-three years young and living in a villa instead of a house , he is a fair target , and let him incorporate , copyright , or patent himself as he will , there are some of his `` works '' that will go swooping up Hannibal chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with , `` I 've heard father tell , '' or possibly , `` Once when I .

The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother -- WAS my mother .
Some day you 've got to prove to the executors that you never inquired .
He had forgotten that detail .
It 's wisdom , Aleck , solid wisdom , and sound as a nut .
But the aunts were obdurate in their righteousness , and said the law that visited the sins of the parent upon the child was by all right and reason reversible ; and therefore it was but just that the innocent mother of a sinning child should suffer her rightful share of the grief and pain and shame which were the allotted wages of the sin .
Helen stirred ; her hands began to grope wistfully about as if they sought something -- she had been blind some hours .
Ambulinia , in her flight , takes refuge in a neighbor 's house .
The villagers gather , attracted by the racket .
The appointed day ushered in undisturbed by any clouds ; nothing disturbed Ambulinia 's soft beauty .
Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow and his golden harp .
`` Ride on , '' said Ambulinia , `` the voice of thunder is behind us . ''
The kind old gentleman met them in the yard : `` Well , '' said he , `` I wish I may die , Elfonzo , if you and Ambulinia have n't tied a knot with your tongue that you ca n't untie with your teeth .
`` Nineteen her last birthday , '' he said , as he put the picture back ; `` and that was the day we were married .

When Baby Benton wanted candy , he cried for it until he got it .
Baby Mills took care of his toys ; Baby Benton always destroyed his in a very brief time , and then made himself so insistently disagreeable that , in order to have peace in the house , little Edward was persuaded to yield up his play-things to him .
But the noble sisterhood rescued him again .
A grand temperance revival was got up , and after some rousing speeches had been made the chairman said , impressively : `` We are not about to call for signers ; and I think there is a spectacle in store for you which not many in this house will be able to view with dry eyes . ''
There was an eloquent pause , and then George Benton , escorted by a red-sashed detachment of the Ladies of the Refuge , stepped forward upon the platform and signed the pledge .
An account of it was published .
Stammattina , circe le 7,30 , mentre Giuseppe Sciatti , di anni 55 , di Casellina e Torri , passava dal Ponte Vecchio , stando seduto sopra un barroccio carico di verdura , perse l ' equilibrio e cadde al suolo , rimanendo con la gamba destra sotto una ruota del veicolo .
Then the listener must be alert , for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way , with the pretense that he does not know it is a nub .
Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal ; then when the belated audience presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise , as if wondering what they had found to laugh at .
People would come from every corner of the globe and stop off to look at it , no tour of the world would be complete that left out Adam's monument .

And so I think it is as I first said : that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and statistics .
It just COMES -- none knows whence -- and can not explain itself .
And does n't need to .
Well , here was that great crowd of prophets of Baal packed together on one side , and Isaac walking up and down all alone on the other , putting up his job .
It wa'n't any use ; they had n't took a trick .
Of course they felt kind of ashamed before all those people , and well they might .
Keep still , would n't he ?
Says he , 'You do n't speak up loud enough ; your god's asleep , like enough , or maybe he 's taking a walk ; you want to holler , you know ' -- or words to that effect ; I do n't recollect the exact language .
Mind , I do n't apologize for Isaac ; he had his faults .
Its outlying borders fringed off and thinned away among the cedar forests , and there was no woody distance of curving coast or leafy islet sleeping upon the dimpled , painted sea , but was flecked with shining white points -- half-concealed houses peeping out of the foliage .
Some ragged-topped cocoa-palms , glimpsed here and there , gave the land a tropical aspect .

What hotel are you stopping at ? ''
There was a very attractive little hotel close by , but our energies were not conquered yet , so we went on .
We were pretty well fagged out , now , but as we did not wish to miss the Alpine sunrise , we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed .
Other artists have done me the grace to admire it ; but I am severe in my judgments of my own pictures , and this one does not move me .
When we began that ascent , we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us .
Still it seemed a long way up in the air , in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks .
It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiard-table , and this grass-plot slanted so sharply downward , and was so brief , and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice , that it was a shuddery thing to think of a person 's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all .
Words can not describe the comfort that that friendly , hopeful , steadfast thing was to me in that season of trouble .
It was a defective barometer , and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer , but I did not know that until afterward .
MR. WHYMPER 'S NARRATIVE We started from Zermatt on the 13th of July , at half past five , on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning .
This was considered a good omen , and little short of miraculous .

The reader may easily believe that the telescopes had plenty of custom on that August morning in 1866 , for everybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot , and all had fears that misfortune would result .
The corpse , upon being viewed at the inquest , showed no bruises , and it was some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken .
One of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries , but the other had suffered no hurt at all .
There was a cabin there -- the spot is called the Caillet -- and a spring of ice-cold water .
We did not invest ; what we wanted was to see a dead one .
Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate of the world and publishes it .
Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1,000 of her population ( yearly average ) , Chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17 , Dublin with her 48 -- and so on .
We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen ; Paris fines the citizen for being run over .
That looked as if they meant to punish him .
There are many aged portraits -- some valuable , some worthless ; some of great interest , some of none at all .
I bought a couple -- one a gorgeous duke of the olden time , and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel , a princess , maybe .
`` They were pretty how-come-you-so by now , and they begun to blow .
Then they wished they had some more company -- and Mr. Emerson pointed to me and says :
I do not object to that , if they needed his fur ; but alive , gentlemen-alive !
If he had been a bird , it would have been all right , and no violence done to his feelings , because he would have been considered `` dressed . ''
I ask you to put yourselves in his place .
Mr. Howells had been granted a degree at Oxford , whose gown was red .
Every born American among the eighty millions , let his creed or destitution of creed be what it may , is indisputably a Christian -- to this degree that his moral constitution is Christian .
It has always been difficult -- leave that word difficult -- not exceedingly difficult , but just difficult , nothing more than that , not the slightest shade to add to that -- just difficult -- to respond properly , in the right phraseology , when compliments are paid to me ; but it is more than difficult when the compliments are paid to a better than I -- my wife .
In proposing the toast of `` The Drama '' Mr. Clemens said :
Oh yes , you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper .
And that is the case with Mr. Mabie .
Mr. Mabie in his private capacity is just as clean a man as I am .
I do n't know what the charm is about me which makes it impossible for a person to say a harsh thing about me and say it heartily , as if he was glad to say it .
He also alluded to my name , of which I am rather fond .
Jack had made a trip as a child almost across this continent in the first overland stage-coach .
That man 's name who ran that line of stages -- well , I declare that name is gone .
Well , we started to find out what was the trouble with the community , and it did n't take long to find out that there was just one disease , and that was race-suicide .

But when a gentleman gets up and merely tells the truth about you , what can you do ?
The first Fourth of July in that noble genealogy dates back seven centuries lacking eight years .
That is the day of the Great Charter -- the Magna Charta -- which was born at Runnymede in the next to the last year of King John , and portions of the liberties secured thus by those hardy Barons from that reluctant King John are a part of our Declaration of Independence , of our Fourth of July , of our American liberties .
And the second of those Fourths of July was not born , until four centuries later , in , Charles the First's time , in the Bill of Rights , and that is ours , that is part of our liberties .
The next one was still English , in New England , where they established that principle which remains with us to this day , and will continue to remain with us -- no taxation without representation .
That is always going to stand , and that the English Colonies in New England gave us .
ADDRESS AT A DINNER GIVEN BY COLONEL GEORGE HARVEY AT DELMONICO 'S , DECEMBER 5 , 1905 , TO CELEBRATE THE SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF MR. CLEMENS ' BIRTH
When we examine the programme of any of these garrulous old people we always find that the habits which have preserved them would have decayed us ; that the way of life which enabled them to live upon the property of their heirs so long , as Mr. Choate says , would have put us out of commission ahead of time .
JOAN HAD said true : France was on the way to be free .
The city provisioned the army , and a deputation waited upon the King , but we did not enter the place .
The news flew everywhere , and shouts of welcome were raised , and in just one little moment those two despised and unknown plebeians were become famous and popular and envied , and everybody was in a fever to get sight of them and be able to say , all their lives long , that they had seen the father of Joan of Arc and the brother of her mother .
And more -- he had conscience ; he had a sense of right and wrong , such as it was ; he was able to find remorse .
Well , then I think they will rise up and demand to be regarded as part of the race , and that by consequence there will be trouble .
They got out the presents which they had been buying to carry home -- humble things and cheap , but they would be fine there , and welcome .
And they gave to Joan a present from Pere Fronte and one from her mother -- the one a little leaden image of the Holy Virgin , the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon ; and she was as pleased as a child ; and touched , too , as one could see plainly enough .
And she said she could almost wish she was going to the wars again ; for then she would fight with the better courage , as having always with her something which her mother 's touch had blessed .
Joan turned to him and said , gravely :
Carry it to Paris . ''
For a while I was not much troubled , for I was expecting every day to hear that Joan had been put to ransom , and that the King -- no , not the King , but grateful France -- had come eagerly forward to pay it .
She could not be called to account for anything under that head .
She must be tried by priests for crimes against religion .
If none could be discovered , some must be invented .
Now , then , this daily baiting and badgering of this friendless girl , a captive in chains , was to continue a long , long time -- dignified sport , a kennel of mastiffs and bloodhounds harassing a kitten !
When poor Joan had been in her grave a quarter of a century , the Pope called together that great court which was to re-examine her history , and whose just verdict cleared her illustrious name from every spot and stain , and laid upon the verdict and conduct of our Rouen tribunal the blight of its everlasting execrations .
Cauchon 's face flushed black with anger to see this plank flung to the perishing child , and he shouted :
Many attempts were made to beguile her into saying indiscreet things , but she saw the purpose in view and answered with tact and wisdom .
Joan had a high fever , and the doctors proposed to bleed her .
`` I believe it can not err ; but for those deeds and words of mine which were done and uttered by command of God , I will answer to Him alone . ''
She stood looking about her in a bewildered way a moment , then slowly she sank to her knees , and bowed her head and said :
Do you think you can bear it ? ''
`` Yes '' -- very softly , and her head drooped again .
`` How fast have we been going ? ''
WE had an early breakfast in the morning , and set looking down on the desert , and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely , although we warn't high up .
I done it , and shot down , feet first , and seemed to go about a mile toward the bottom ; and when I come up , he says :
`` Well , you ca n't fool me , '' says the driver .
and A HORSE CA N'T FLY ! ''
Why , she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second .
I do not mind your trying to tell them , if you like , but I will protect your tongues , and nothing of the secret will escape from them . ''
We said we must be with him all the time ; we must have all of him we could ; the days were precious now .
Yet we did not go to seek him .
`` It is happening now .
In his anger Fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but for this accident .
One of you will die to-morrow week ; another of you will die to-night ; the third has but five minutes to live -- and yonder is the clock ! ''
