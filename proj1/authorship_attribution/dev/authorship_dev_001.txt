`` You 'd better take this lot first , Tom , '' said Jessica .
She turned briskly on Bert .
`` Good heavens ! ''
said Dymchurch , `` what 's this ? ''
She was still quite impassive .
`` Do you spik Cherman , Herr Booteraidge ? ''
The red glow Bert had seen through the column of clouds came from the luckless Susquehanna ; she lay almost immediately below , burning fore and aft , but still fighting two of her guns and steaming slowly southward .
To Bert , however , the names of all these ships were unknown , and for a considerable time indeed , misled by the direction in which the combatants were moving , he imagined the Germans to be Americans and the Americans Germans .
Then for a time he was hopelessly at a loss .
He saw these ironclads , too , not in profile , as he was accustomed to see ironclads in pictures , but in plan and curiously foreshortened .
I 'm gettin ' giddy .
He came upon the second aeroplane in a clear grassy space by the side of the streaming water , and it seemed scarcely damaged at all .
There it lay abandoned , with the water lapping about its long tail .
Thence he made his way , with the kitten skirmishing along beside him in the grass , to a staircase that led to a lump of projecting rock that enfiladed the huge green majesty of the Horseshoe Fall .
He stood there for some time in silence .
With that apparition began a new phase of Goat Island in Bert's experience .
They too were in this scrape with him , marooned and puzzled .
What mattered it if one was a Prince and both were foreign soldiers , if neither perhaps had adequate English ?
he said ; `` 'ow did you get 'ere ? ''
said the proprietor , sharply .
Progress had marched as it seemed invincible about the earth , never now to rest again .
They had been there six days ... .
`` You see , Sir Isaac , '' she said , taking him in , in the most generous way ; `` I and Mr. Brumley are old friends .
We knew each other of yore .
We have our jokes . ''
`` I 've not seen her myself yet , '' said Lady Beach-Mandarin .
I do n't think I have ever seen such a charming combination of blossoms ! ''
Miss Sawbridge , stirred by the great waves of violent philoprogenitive enthusiasm that circled out from Lady Beach-Mandarin , had caught up the baby and was hugging it and addressing it in terms of humorous rapture , and the nurse and her assistant were keeping respectful but wary eyes upon the handling of their four charges .
Miss Sharsper was taking in the children 's characteristics with a quick expertness .
`` You heard me breaking my shins on that infernal flower-pot you put for me , and out you shot with all your pack of old women and chased me round the garden .
`` Rather tantalizing these meetings at table , '' he said .
`` My dear Lady Harman , I find myself -- -- Ridiculous position .
You have shared Lady Harman's astonishment at the ardour of his few stolen words in the garden , an astonishment that not only grew but flowered in the silences of her captivity , and you know something of the romantic impulses , more at least than she did , that gave his appearance at the little local railway station so belated and so disreputable a flavour .
In this however she was mistaken ; Mr. Brumley had really been proposing an elopement and he was now entirely preoccupied with the idea of rescuing , obtaining and possessing Lady Harman for himself as soon as the law released her .
And besides -- I did n't somehow want to come to you . ''
`` I mean about my being a mere girl , almost a child when I married him .
And quite as naturally he did n't notice that now I am a woman , grown up altogether .
And naturally , Mr. Brumley , they shocked and upset him .
It was a _generous_ letter , Mr. Brumley .
Generous about all sorts of affairs that there had been between us .
There were many interruptions to this research , but she persevered .
And then he would break her down by pitiful appeals .
`` A girl can get this cubicle for three-and-six a week , '' said Sir Isaac , tapping the drawing before him with his pencil .
Say her bus fares and lunch out mean another four shillings .
There 's nothing like it to be got now for twice the money .
`` That is just what I am driving at . ''
Mr. Brumley gathered himself together for the new aspect .
Her reason was so much with the matrons ; her sympathies so much with the girls .
And it did not help the staff to a triumphant achievement of its duties that the girls had an exaggerated perception that Lady Harman 's heart was on their side .
Sir Isaac 's silhouette was obstinate .
He suddenly gave way to his irritation .
He was one of those men whose face suggests the word `` muzzle , '' with an erect combative nose and a forward slant of the body from the rather inturned feet .
He had evidently started out in the morning with misconceptions about the weather .
And it was clear he felt he had blundered in coming into Westridge 's .
She was silent for a moment .
Mr. Bunting was on the point of telling her to hold tight and she would be quite safe , when a little wave went almost entirely into his mouth and reduced him to wild splutterings .
He sees nothing of that traffic .
He sees the little sea garden at Sandgate and that little group of people very small and bright and something -- something hanging over them .
`` It is n't fair on them -- or me -- or anybody ! ''
`` They rushed me , anyhow .
`` Middle of the stage , I suppose , '' said Fred .
It came into Melville 's head for a moment that this girl had something in her , perhaps , that was just a little beyond his former judgments .
`` I do not know what way .
`` What things unseen ? ''
`` So many people do , '' said Lady Poynting Mallow .
They stood side by side -- looking down upon the harbour .
Behind , the evening band played remotely and the black little promenaders went to and fro under the tall electric lights .
I think Chatteris decided to be very self-possessed at first -- a man of the world .
It 's -- arduous .
There are places to climb that are not only steep but muddy -- -- ''
He witnesses that at a quarter past eleven he went up to ask Chatteris if there was anything more to do that night , and found him seated in an arm-chair before the open window , with his chin upon his hands , staring at nothing -- which , indeed , as Schopenhauer observes in his crowning passage , is the whole of human life .
And I remember how later we found ourselves on Westminster Bridge , looking back upon the long sweep of wrinkled black water that reflected lights and palaces and the flitting glow of steamboats , and by that time we had talked ourselves past our despair .
The fundamental idea upon which Socialism rests is the same fundamental idea as that upon which all real scientific work is carried on .
The Socialist has just that same faith in the order , the knowableness of things and the power of men in co-operation to overcome chance ; but to him , dealing as he does with the social affairs of men , it takes the form not of schemes for collective research but for collective action and the creation of a comprehensive design for all the social activities of man .
While Science gathers knowledge , Socialism in an entirely harmonious spirit criticizes and develops a general plan of social life .
`` Observe how private enterprise supplies the streets with milk .
At 7.30 a milk cart comes lumbering along and delivers milk at one house and away again .
-- and there come more or less harmful dilutions and adulterations and exposures to infection at every handling , at every chance at profit making .
You note the charge of `` inhumanity '' in the very first line , and in much subsequent press comment there was the same note .
Apparently every one expects a doctor to be ready at any point in the day or night to attend anybody for nothing .
Most Socialists are disposed to agree with the spirit of that expectation .
He is a private adventurer , competing in a crowded market for gain , and keeping his energies perforce for those who can pay best for them .
`` 'To build up a body of social and economic science , to develop a class of trained administrators , to rearrange local government areas , to educate the whole community in the `` sense of the State '' are necessary parts of the Socialist scheme .
It is the systematization of present tendency .
Necessarily its methods of transition will be progressively scientific and humane .
The error in all these cases is the error of overstatement , of getting into a condition of confused intellectual excitement , and because a critic declares your window curtains too blue , saying , therefore , and usually with passion , that he wants the whole universe , sky and sea included , painted bright orange .
If after that critic 's little proposition about your window curtains he chances to say that on the whole he thinks an orange sky would be unpleasant , the common practice is to accuse him of not `` sticking to his guns . ''
Anarchism , then , is as it were a final perversion of the Socialist stream , a last meandering of Socialist thought , released from vitalizing association with an active creative experience .
Anarchism comes when the Socialist repudiation of property is dropped into the circles of thought of men habitually ruled and habitually irresponsible , men limited in action and temperamentally adverse to the toil , to the vexatious rebuffs and insufficiencies , the dusty effort , fatigue , and friction of the practical pursuit of a complex ideal .
The American is no doubt intensely patriotic , but the nation and the State to which his patriotism points is something overhead and comprehensive like the sky , like a flag hoisted ; something , indeed , that not only does not but must not interfere with his ordinary business occupations .
In the history of thought in Victorian Great Britain , one sees a constant conflict of this administrative disposition with the individualistic commercialism of the aggressively trading and manufacturing class , the class that in America reigns unchallenged to this day .
In the latter country Individualism reigns unchallenged , it is assumed ; in the former it has fought an uphill fight against the traditions of Church and State and has never absolutely prevailed .
The political economists and Herbert Spencer were its prophets , and they never at any time held the public mind in any invincible grip .
Socialistic thought and legislation , therefore , was going on in Great Britain through all the Victorian period .
Nevertheless , it was the Fabian Society that , in the eighties and through the intellectual impetus of at most four or five personalities , really brought this obstinately administrative spirit in British affairs into relation with Socialism as such .
The leading conception of this Administrative Area paper appeared subsequently running through a series of tracts , _The New Heptarchy Series_ , in which one finds it applied first to this group of administrative problems and then to that .
And yet I find it hard to do even this measure of justice to my friend .
There was a certain quality in his life -- it was pleasant .
You see the wrangling argument on which they were launched .
`` It isn't just these matured showings .

The Author went to the bell and asked for red pepper .
Then he examined the trumpet more carefully and discovered the mice and fluff and other things in it , and demanded that it should be cleaned ; and the old dealer , nothing loth , knowing they were used to automobile-horns and such-like instruments , agreed to let them clean it on condition that they left it shiney .
The toolshed windows were broken and the various apparatus and cars around were much displaced , and _no traces of the trumpet were ever discovered_ .

Mr. Bensington certainly sniffed critically at this disorder , but he made no unnecessary fuss , and even when he found a wasp regaling itself in a gallipot half full of Herakleophorbia IV , he simply remarked mildly that his substance was better sealed from the damp than exposed to the air in that manner .
`` So far as this trouble down in Kent goes I am not disposed to worry further . ''
`` D'yer mean -- Flack -- '' said another .
`` Confound it ! ''
Men went to and fro about him -- grimy , energetic men .

It has been scattered recklessly -- so he says -- and it may be scattered again .

He became visible in the middle of the room rubbing his hands together .
Finally -- upset every human concern .
They 're going to try and stop it , but they 're too late .
You go on and start as much of it as you can .
He was a man of moderate height , a little shortened in appearance by his equatorial dimensions , and a face that had been mellow from the first was now climacterically ripe .
The beard of a David hid his redundancy of chin ; he wore no watch chain out of refinements and his modest clerical garments were made by a West End tailor ... .
`` We are in a fastness of the hills , '' he expanded .
`` Besides , Brothers , except for vermin , except for little accidents with evil things , what have we seen of killing ? ''
`` This is the echo of Caterham , '' said his friend .
`` Look , '' she interrupted , and he heard a yelping horn .
`` I do n't know .
But now , poor wretch , he seems to have felt the need of some weapon .
He turned back towards the goods yard of the Great Western Railway , wrenched up the standard of a tall arc light , a formidable mace for him , and flung it over his shoulder .
And finding the police still turning up to pester him , he went back along the Edgware Road , towards Cricklewood , and struck off sullenly to the north .
Then in an instant the officer had slung himself back over the wall , and sixty feet above him the great electric standard whirled down to his death .
The riflemen dodged this way and that and turned valiantly to fire again .
He had a vision of houses and greenhouses and gardens , of people dodging at windows , the whole swaying fearfully and mysteriously .
He seems to have made three stumbling strides , to have raised and dropped his huge mace , and to have clutched his chest .
If he made any mistake it was when ever and again his fatigue got the better of his immediate attention , and the habit of the public meeting carried him away .
The first difficulty in the way of establishing a world peace is that it is nobody 's business in particular .
Nearly all of us want a world peace -- in an amateurish sort of way .
There is no one in all the world who is responsible for the understanding and overcoming of the difficulties involved .
For it would not be upon a credit basis , but a socialistic basis , a basis of direct reality , and its need for payments would be incidental .
And land-owning peasants growing their own food would carry on , and small cultivating occupiers , who could easily fall back on barter for anything needed .
An individual when he goes bankrupt is measured by the monetary standard of the country he is in ; he pays five or ten or fifteen or so many shillings in the pound .
It still pays a pound , but the purchasing power of the pound has diminished .
This is automatic national bankruptcy ; unplanned , though perhaps not unforeseen .
In the minds of such people as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer they superseded God .
All of us human beings were made , I believe , of very similar clay , and very similar causes have been at work everywhere .
I do not see that it is any consolation to share in a general disaster .
So I spread out the considerations that I think justify our forecasting , in a very changed Great Britain and a changed Europe , firstly , a legal profession with a quickened conscience , a sense of public function and a reformed organisation , and , secondly , a Press , which is recognised and held accountable in law and in men 's minds , as an estate of the realm , as something implicitly under oath to serve the State .
I do not agree with Professor Michel 's pessimistic conclusion that peace will bring back exacerbated party politics and a new era of futility to the democratic countries .
Such , it seems to me , is the most open possibility in the European map in the years immediately before us .
Britain also has possessions of this type in Central Africa and the less civilised districts of India , but Russia has scarcely anything of the sort .

`` But I should have thought an aeroplane ? ''
Oh , but she was brave and patient !
At first there were other fugitives , but we did not mingle with them .
Many of the men were impressed .
Dim shapes of men passed to and fro without .

Yet he felt strangely elated , and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon him .
This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi , except to ask a few questions .
Azuma-zi explained that he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo .
Among his hearers was a girl , with eyelids less red and sunken than the others , so that one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes , whom especially he hoped to persuade .
They told him there were indeed no mountains at all , but that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world ; thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe , from which the dew and the avalanches fell ; and when he maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they supposed , they said his thoughts were wicked .
One morning he saw Pedro in the path called Seventeen and coming towards the central houses , but still too far off for hearing or scent , and he told them as much .
`` In a little while , '' he prophesied , `` Pedro will be here . ''
An old man remarked that Pedro had no business on path Seventeen , and then , as if in confirmation , that individual as he drew near turned and went transversely into path Ten , and so back with nimble paces towards the outer wall .
He was trying to get his breath .
His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted , and then back to the woman .

The odd-job man was coming up the garden , amazed at the smashing of glass , and saw her emerge , hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands .
Then the dome of the observatory resounded with a series of thundering blows .
I remember one odd thing , and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke .
One was the village doctor .
The bay opened out , and a gap in the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the sea ; the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course down the distant hill slope .
Then I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of matter had shrunk there was a faint glow .
And in a band on either side of that the darkness was not absolute .
And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the faintest , palest brown .
What was unfolding itself ?
He went to the tiller , while the boatman and one of the workmen seated themselves and began rowing .
The other workman stood up in the fore part of the boat , with the boat-hook , ready to strike any more tentacles that might appear .
Nothing else seems to have been said .
In a hushed , scared mood , with faces white and drawn , they set about escaping from the position into which they had so recklessly blundered .
I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times .
I cried , with a queer high note getting into my voice somehow .
It 's downright selfishness .

`` You would n't believe , '' said Mrs. Coombes .
Then at the sight of their startled faces he changed , with the swift transition of insanity , into overbearing fury .
`` If I am to be failed this examination , I might as well go home at once . ''
He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay .
`` I was thinking , '' he said , `` I might be able ( _chum , chum_ ) to work ( _chum , chum_ ) a miracle with Mrs. Minchin ( _chum , chum_ ) -- make her a better woman . ''
`` But what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think when they came back .
If they 'd seen me in the boat before I went down , and without the helmet on -- for they might have been spying and hiding since over night -- they would very likely take a different view from the others .
`` That was my last chance .
`` Why should it be given to one man to say 'Come on ! '
with that stupendous violence of effect ?

thought the little man .
The little man , by way of comparison , reflected on the gaunt rider with the scarred lip , as stalwart as his master , as brave and , indeed , perhaps braver , and yet for him there was obedience , nothing but to give obedience duly and stoutly ...
`` Get on ! ''
How _can_ they matter ?
Back to the trail ! ''
He fell swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its mouth .
Frozen people stood erect , strange , silent , self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in mid-stride , promenading upon the grass .
I passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping , and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth .
A wink , studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford , is an unattractive thing .

Holroyd was half-way up the companion .
Well , I do n't resort to that explanation now .

When at last this stops and the infantry goes forward to rout out the trenches and the dug-outs , they go forward with a minimum of inconvenience .
They run as fast as they can , hands up , and are shepherded farther back .
He was a man of five-and-forty .
Incidentally he mentioned that he had never taken anything for his private life out of the great business he had built up but a salary , `` a good salary , '' and that now he was gong to grant himself a pension .
The German papers openly boast that they are building up a big mercantile marine that will start out to take up the world 's overseas trade directly peace is declared .
We have heard a very great deal about the German will-to-power in this war , but there is something very much older and tougher and less blatant and conspicuous , the British will .
Isbister took up the portfolio , opened it , put it down , hesitated , seemed about to speak .
`` Perhaps , '' he whispered doubtfully .
Presently he glanced at the door and back to the figure .
He bent down until the two heads were ear to ear .
`` And there 's been the War , '' said Isbister .
For a moment it resisted his hand , bending outward like a distended bladder , then it broke with a slight report and vanished -- a pricked bubble .
He reeled out into the general space of the hall , greatly astonished .
`` I ca n't come , '' said the thickset man ; `` I have _him_ to see to .
The lift stopped , and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passage between high walls , along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables .
Then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that .
He suddenly realised what this might be , and stepped back to regard it .
Desire and indulgence are life in a sense -- and Death !

But the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly white , broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable darkness , vast ungainly Titans of shadow .
Wherever the snow-spangled light struck down , beams and girders , and incessant bands running with a halting , indomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black .
There was a tumult of yells , screams and cries .
Graham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to do with the people below .
The song and the tramping had ceased .
`` The lights ! ''
The huge white globes became purple-white , purple with a reddish glow , flickered , flickered faster and faster , fluttered between light and extinction , ceased to flicker and became mere fading specks of glowing red in a vast obscurity .
For a time his attention was absorbed in the fragments of speech he heard .
The impression the people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the old man 's faith in Ostrog .
It was only slowly he could bring himself to believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat of the Council , that the Council which had pursued him with such power and vigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict .
They have only a thousand men or so , and some of these men will be disloyal .
They have little ammunition .
Within one hundred and fifty years of Graham 's falling asleep , his Council had thrown off its disguises and ruled openly , supreme in his name .
Awoke to stand under the cloudless empty sky and gaze down upon the greatness of his dominion .
But I 'm the Master , and I mean to know . ''
`` That , '' and he indicated the white thing still fluttering down , `` was a swan . ''
I have prayed that I might see you and tell you these things .
But the upper portion of each door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that had enclosed him at his awakening , and within , dimly seen , lay , in every case , a very young baby in a little nest of wadding .
Behind and about her marched a riot of applause .
To stand wrong is to share the guilt . ''
Without came the shrill ringing of a bell , the sound of feet and the gabble of a phonographic message .

Sir Richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from Salisbury station to the Old George after his farewell to Martineau .
He felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being .
He smiled at the idea of any facile passion in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality .
But passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common .
It might happen , but it was n't so necessary ... .
His plans were already quite clear .
They would lunch in Shaftesbury and walk round it .
Thence they would go on to Wells to see yet another great cathedral and to dine and sleep .

Religion is not a plant that has grown from one seed ; it is like a lake that has been fed by countless springs .
It is a great pool of living water , mingled from many sources and tainted with much impurity .
The Triune Persons -- omnipresent , omniscient , and omnipotent -- exist for all time , superior to and independent of matter .
Those who profess modern religion conceive that this is an excessive abstraction of the idea of spirituality , a disembodiment of the idea of personality beyond the limits of the conceivable ; nevertheless they accept the conception that a person , a spiritual individual , may be without an ordinary mortal body .
`` The revolt which burns in so much of the abler literature of our time is an unselfish revolt , or non-selfish revolt : it is an outcome of that larger spirit which conceives the self to be a part of the general social organism , and it is therefore neither egoistic nor altruistic .
It speaks of the claims of truth and justice , and assails untruth and injustice , for these are elemental principles of social life ; but it appeals more confidently to the warmer sympathy which is linking the scattered children of the race , and it urges all to co-operate in the restriction of suffering and the creation of happiness .
This is the same Link and Captain that this book asserts .
Is not the real deception , our belief that we are completely individualised , and is it not possible that this that Professor Murray calls `` instinct '' is really not a vestige but a new thing arising out of our increasing understanding , an intellectual penetration to that greater being of the species , that vine , of which we are the branches ?
But first let me write a few words here about those who hold a kind of intermediate faith between the worship of the God of Youth and the vaguer sort of Christianity .
And they would assert , what we of the new belief , pleading our profound ignorance , would neither assert nor deny , that that Darkness , out of which came Life and God , since it produced them must be ultimately sympathetic and of like nature with them .
And that ultimately Man , being redeemed and led by Christ and saved from death by him , would be reconciled with God the Father .
If a professional religious has any justification at all for his professionalism it is surely that he proclaims the nearness and greatness of God .
For they had forgotten about matches .
I began , bawling like an angry child , laying hands upon them and shaking them up together .
It must have been very queer to them .
Some laughed , most of them looked sorely frightened .
For , reasoning from their daylight behaviour , I thought that fear must be forgotten .
'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain , when we approached it about noon , deserted and falling into ruin .
I thought then -- though I never followed up the thought -- of what might have happened , or might be happening , to the living things in the sea .
This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire .
'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over .
As I returned , I passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory .

Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night .
Then , as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face , the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked .
`` Am I dreaming ?
Has the world gone mad -- or have I ? ''
`` Then far down the place , in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds , I saw two men approaching .
I scrambled to my feet , looking about me for some way of escape , and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me .
cried one , and 'Stop there ! '
-- on a lanky lad of fifteen .
In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , 'All hands to the doors ! '
`` His hand was on the handle of a door , and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face .
The man must have had diabolically acute hearing .
_Had_ you any plan ? ''
And then things happened very swiftly .
The Invisible Man started and stood still .
cried the Voice , and suddenly the dressing-gown opened , and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe .
But it was five minutes before he went to the window again .
Life was not altogether a lark .
A minute or so after Platt dashed in .
Mrs. Punt , breaking out suddenly : `` Do n't _swaller_ your fork , Willy .
And also Mr. Polly bought a number of books , Rabelais for his own , and `` The Arabian Nights , '' the works of Sterne , a pile of `` Tales from Blackwood , '' cheap in a second-hand bookshop , the plays of William Shakespeare , a second-hand copy of Belloc 's `` Road to Rome , '' an odd volume of `` Purchas his Pilgrimes '' and `` The Life and Death of Jason . ''
He saw his bicycle in the hall and cut it dead .
All right , reely .
But Mr. Polly felt that their condition must be nakedly exposed to the ridicule of the world by such a linking , and evaded her movement .
`` Never thought of that , O ' Man , '' said Mr. Polly , and reflected silently upon the needlessness of Miriam .
Someone was nudging him .
It was Johnson 's finger diverted his eyes to the crucial place in the prayer-book to which they had come .

Then the public houses began to vomit forth the less desirable elements of Fishbourne society , boys and men were moved to run and shout , and more windows went up as the stir increased .
cried Mr. Gambell , `` the key ! ''
Presently a little chat sprang up upon the causes of fires , and Mr. Polly was moved to tell how it had happened for the one and twentieth time .
His story had now become as circumstantial and exact as the evidence of a police witness .
Thing was aflare in a moment !
`` Hello , '' said Mr. Polly , and saved himself in the nick of time from disaster .
`` He comes and scoots them .
He 'll scoot you too , I expect . ''
`` It 's a kindness I'm doing to warn you .
I do n't stick at nuffin ' . ''
But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ , it is a matter rather of common sense than of scientific knowledge that , if the conditions under which a species live are changed , the species should undergo some correlated changes .
This process , which is called Natural Selection , is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction { 18 } from the facts of reproduction and individual difference .

As ships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves .
Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of the northern forests and plains .
In India and China there were parallel developments .
They were nearer the level of the ancient Sumerians or of the Maya civilization of America .
Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this , that their God was invisible and remote , an invisible God in a temple not made with hands , a Lord of Righteousness throughout the earth .
And this God of Abraham , the Jews believed , had chosen them to be his peculiar people , to restore Jerusalem and make it the capital of Righteousness in the World .
the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering destruction and deportation , and while the Jewish people were developing their tradition in captivity in Babylon , another great power over the human mind , the Greek tradition , was also arising .
So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached beyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers collected by the first two Ptolemies .
Within the blaze may be blindingly bright , but nevertheless it is unseen .
Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon { 154 } Alexandria .
Then it stirred and began to germinate .
, the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revived in Rome .
The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a slave .
In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved .
This new Persia , the Persia of the Sassenid kings , was to be a vigorous and on the whole a successful rival of the Roman Empire in Asia for the next three centuries .
All over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were reigning as kings , dukes and the like , practically independent but for the most part professing some sort of shadowy allegiance to the emperor .
The superior clergy and a small remnant of other educated men read and wrote Latin .
Everywhere life was insecure and property was held by the strong arm .

One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a certain Venetian , Marco Polo , who afterwards set down his story in a book .
Their visit with Marco was their second visit .
it was a return to elemental things .
He had never acquired the habit of reading , but he would be read aloud to at meals after the fashion of Charlemagne , and would make what one narrator describes as a `` sweet and heavenly commentary . ''
These exercises and the gout released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been restrained by considerations of policy .
He recommended , as an example , his own mode or proceeding in the Netherlands , `` where all who remained obstinate in their errors were burned alive , and those who were admitted to penitence were beheaded . ''
There was to be an end to compromise at home and abroad ; at home royalists and every form of disloyalty were to be stamped out ; abroad France was to be the protector and helper of all revolutionaries .
All Europe , all the world , was to become Republican .
Before that chant and the leaping columns of French bayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies rolled back ; before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far beyond the utmost achievements of Louis XIV ; everywhere they stood on { 344 } foreign soil .
And this provocation united all England against France , whereas there had been at first a very considerable liberal movement in Great Britain in sympathy with the revolution .
But in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the increase of the European populations was obliging their governments to look abroad for staple foods ; and the growth of scientific industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials , fats and greases of every kind , rubber , and other hitherto disregarded substances .

`` There 's a cliff like that at Lulworth Cove -- as high , anyhow -- and a little girl fell from top to bottom .
And lives to-day -- sound and well . ''
There was a distinct impression , too , of a momentous conversation , of a name -- he could not tell what name -- that was subsequently to recur , of some queer long-forgotten sensation of vein and muscle , of a feeling of vast hopeless effort , the effort of a man near drowning in darkness .
Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes ... .
He pressed his throat and tried a third time .
`` How long ? ''
he asked in a level voice .
They were shouting -- ? ''
Light and so forth . ''
What council could it be that gathered there , that little body of men beneath the significant white Atlas , secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness ?
`` Thi Man huwdbi Kin '' forced itself on him as `` The Man who would be King . ''
`` To the hall about the markets .
The people are drilled , the Wind-Vane police , the engineers , and half the way-gearers are with us .
We have the halls crowded -- shouting .
`` Between them and not across them , '' said the voice .
Our Leader -- in your name . ''
Men and women of the new age !
The whole world seemed marching .
The garments waved onward , the faces poured by more abundantly .
The wind-vane people , the Labour Company and its millions , burst the bonds .
The bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the mysteries of Eadhamite when he perceived the girl he had seen in the theatre again .
`` But burning women alive ! ''
You are Master , the world is yours .
The place seemed to him to be dense with people either profoundly agitated or swelling with obscure cunning , yet he learnt that the place was comparatively empty , that the great political convulsion of the last few days had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum .
They ran along it , so near were they that Graham could see the weapons in their hands .
Then Ostrog was shouting in his ear to the men who held him , and once more he was struggling with all his strength against their endeavours to thrust him towards the opening that yawned to receive him .
We 'll save him from them yet . ''
-- on the analogy of `` Squiggles '' she might come to call him `` Mangles ! ''
`` Out of defiance .
She just sat and told me that was her arrangement .
`` Bother it all ! ''
But after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had fallen thinking of the events of the day .
She had decided that she would spend the next morning answering advertisements in the papers that abounded in the writing-room ; and so , after half an hour 's perusal of back numbers of the Sketch in the drawing-room , she had gone to bed .
She was greatly heartened by doing this .
The talk became more and more inconclusive and exhausting .
she said , `` I ca n't -- ''
It contained three sovereigns , six and fourpence , two postage stamps , a small key , and her aunt 's return half ticket to Morningside Park .
And more boys die than girls , so that the real disproportion among adults is even greater . ''
She found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face .
She noted that as a good saying , and it germinated and spread tentacles of explanation through her brain .
And all the talk of the Miniver people and the Widgett people seemed always to be like a ship in adverse weather on the lee shore of love .
Ann Veronica looked at her thoughtfully for a moment , and decided to persist on principle .
He stared in amazement at this new aspect of the situation .
`` You love some one else ? ''
`` One does n't want to turn the whole thing into a mere sex antagonism . ''
`` I 'm simply discovering that life is many-sided and complex and puzzling .
`` You 've got to take the decent reasonable way .
Every one else does . ''
He was suddenly resentful .
I do n't see any good in life if it has n't got you in it .
I wanted you to know .
You ca n't look me in the eyes and say you do n't care for me . ''
She put her hand in his to be squeezed .
`` And then ? ''
`` What did your aunt say ? ''
I remember the occasion with extreme vividness .
`` But what good will that do ? ''
For just one instant I had a sense of enormous tension , a transient conviction that my feet were pressing downward with a force of countless tons .
His face caught something of my dismay .
We were afraid to strike out across this space , but as it presented less obstruction to our crawling than the scrub , we went down upon it and began very circumspectly to skirt its edge .
I saw , also , that this mitigation of the darkness was not blue , as all the other light within the moon had been , but a pallid gray , a very vague , faint white , the daylight colour .
`` We might write up inscriptions on walls -- ''
I heard footsteps crunching in the sand , and a little round-faced , friendly-looking man in flannels , with a bathing towel wrapped about his shoulders , and his bathing dress over his arm , appeared up the beach .
Cavor , we learnt , was not only alive , but free , in the midst of an almost inconceivable community of these ant-like beings , these ant-men , in the blue darkness of the lunar caves .
But curiously enough he seemed to be labouring under a conviction that I was either dead in the moon crater or lost in the deep of space .
Tsi-puff took up position behind him .
I seated myself Turkish fashion , and Phi-oo and Tsi-puff also knelt down above me .
This over-accentuation in the past of man 's egoistic individuality , or , if one puts it in another way , this unsuspicious ignorance of the real nature of life , becomes glaringly conspicuous in such weighed and deliberate utterances as _The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius_ .
One citation will serve to show the colour of all his thought .
That indeed is the rule for all the devotions of that departing generation of wisdom .
But before these are considered , let us sweep out of our present regard a number of cruel and mischievous ideas that are altogether too ascendant at the present time .
We recognize this quite abundantly in the laboratory nowadays , but we neglect it enormously in the more theoretical study of a subject .
The facts of a subject if it is a science may be got at in the most thorough way by handling in the laboratory , but the ideas of a subject must be handled in discussion , reproduction and dispute .
But Professors who are under the burthen of perhaps ninety or a hundred lectures a year can not be expected to do anything of this sort .
Then I fetched out the servant , telling her I would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for .
I went in again , according to my promise , to get my servant 's box , lugged it out , clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart , and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver 's seat beside my wife .
and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly .
In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me , and passed uphill towards Pyrford .
I got up almost mechanically , went into the dining room and drank some whiskey , and then I was moved to change my clothes .
Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive , but not in time to dodge , the fourth shell .
My brother felt no anxiety about us , as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house .
He made up his mind to run down that night to me , in order , as he says , to see the Things before they were killed .
He dispatched a telegram , which never reached me , about four o'clock , and spent the evening at a music hall .
And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief :
The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased ; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence .
Never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still .
They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze .
It is convenient to divide tissues into three classes , though the divisions are by no means clearly marked , nor have they any scientific value .
The first of these comprises tissues composed wholly , or with the exception of an almost imperceptible cementing substance , of cells ; the second division includes the skeletal tissues , the tissue of mesentery , and the connective and basement tissue of most of the organs , tissues which , generally speaking , consist of a matrix or embedding substance , formed by the cells and outside of them , as well as the cells themselves ; and , thirdly , muscular and nervous tissue .

Magnet , '' she said meekly .
When somebody wanted junket , he had made no fuss , he had just helped them to junket .
That play of his ; what is it called ?
I think that is the most wonderful of gifts .
Or perhaps she was only better informed .
`` Wathall ... '' said Sir Rupert suddenly , and tried again : `` Wathall . ''
... You do n't play golf , do you , by any chance ? ''
`` I 'd have been glad , '' said Sir Rupert , `` if a hen had laid an egg and clucked a bit .
I 'd have sung out myself if it had n't been for these infernal ribs ... . ''
`` I think it is such a graceful game for a girl . ''
`` I do n't know _why_ , '' said Marjorie , `` I wonder as much as you .
she did so wish Mr. Pope would lie quiet . )
`` You 're _sure_ she was n't kissing him ? ''
she 'll admit it some day -- readily enough .
But I believe a girl of her spirit would rather _die_ than begin explaining .
Really you ca n't . ''
`` I do n't think you ought to stay in Buryhamstreet , Mr. Trafford , '' said Marjorie .
She looked into the glowing recesses of the fire before her and controlled her voice by an effort .
He stared down at her for a moment ; then he knelt down beside her and took her hand and kissed it .
He gulped as he came in , and his eyes were painfully eager .
`` She 's been ? ''
You may perhaps increase the amount of milk in babies , and the amount of whitewash in cottages and slums by your methods -- I do n't dispute the promise of your statistics -- but you 're going to do it at a cost of human self-respect that 's out of all proportion -- -- ''

A memory of Orta and its reeds and sunshine and love rose like a luminous mist between them ... .
Only her elopement and marriage had prevented her being president of her college Debating Society .
Yes ; she had to go in for a Movement .
She waited some moments .
He looked perhaps a little lost .
All the dress and display and competition . ''
It 's because I 've seen the streaks of gold that I know the rest for dirt .
He found himself jostling through the shopping crowd on the sunny side of Regent Street .
He felt now that he looked over the swarming , preoccupied heads at distant things .
He and Marjorie were going out of it all , going clean out of it all .
He turned back for another handclasp as the others under their light returning packs were filing down the hill .
For nearly four weeks indeed they were occupied very closely , and crept into their bunks at night as tired as wholesome animals who drop to sleep .
At any time the weather might break ; already there had been two overcast days and a frowning conference of clouds in the north .
She was for starting at once , and then remembered this was not the way of the wilderness .
That 's a point .
He turned his head at the sound of the biscuit tin and watched her put out the precious discs .
Perhaps after all she had not wasted a moment of his life , perhaps every issue between them had been necessary , and it was good altogether to be turned from the study of crystals to the study of men and women ... .
We could drag and carry all our food ... . ''
When he spoke his voice was guttural with emotion .
The day after was Sunday , and Louis Napoleon would not look at the sledges or packing .
Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who write about toys .
The praises of the toy theatre have been a common theme for essayists , the planning of the scenes , the painting and cutting out of the caste , penny plain twopence coloured , the stink and glory of the performance and the final conflagration .
I had such a theatre once , but I never loved it nor hoped for much from it ; my bricks and soldiers were my perpetual drama .
I recall an incessant variety of interests .
And there were battles on the way .
And quite abruptly , without any intimation , they vanished and came to the meeting place no more , they vanished as a moth goes out of a window into the night , and left me possessed of an intolerable want ... .
`` I 'm not going to do any fine writing , '' said Shoesmith .
`` I do n't mind a certain refinement and dignity , '' he admitted generously .
until it leads to our coming to -- to the business at last with nothing but a few prohibitions , a few hints , a lot of dirty jokes and , and `` -- he waved a hand and seemed to seek and catch his image in the air -- '' oh , a confounded buttered slide of sentiment , to guide us .

You men can go out into the world if you like , to sin like fools and marry like fools , not knowing what you are doing and ashamed to ask .
The current of living and contemporary ideas in which my mind was presently swimming made all in the same direction ; in place of my mother 's attentive , meticulous but occasionally extremely irascible Providence , the talk was all of the Struggle for Existence and the survival not of the Best -- that was nonsense , but of the fittest to survive .
`` Socialism , '' said Chris Robinson , as if it answered everything , and Hatherleigh said `` Hear !
Such was the England renewed we had in mind , and how to serve that end , to subdue undisciplined worker and undisciplined wealth to it , and make the Scientific Commonweal , King , was the continuing substance of our intercourse .
`` To think we are just to enjoy ourselves , '' she went on ; `` just to go on dressing and playing and having meals and spending money ! ''
`` I do wish I had not had to come down .

The Baileys were very anxious to win me to co-operation , and I was quite prepared at first to identify their distinctive expressions with phrases of my own , and so we came very readily into an alliance that was to last some years , and break at last very painfully .
Altiora manifestly liked me , I was soon discussing with her the perplexity I found in placing myself efficiently in the world , the problem of how to take hold of things that occupied my thoughts , and she was sketching out careers for my consideration , very much as an architect on his first visit sketches houses , considers requirements , and puts before you this example and that of the more or less similar thing already done ... .
After that adventure at Locarno sex and the interests and desires of sex never left me for long at peace .
She was silent for some seconds .
`` I had forgotten , '' she said .
It came to me with extreme vividness that it was n't so much that I had got hold of something as that something had got hold of me .
I said , `` I wo n't be overwhelmed .
In the end I made some very rapid decisions , but for nearly two years I was hesitating .
Hesitations were inevitable in such a matter .
How far can Conservatism be induced to plan and construct before it resists the thrust towards change .
Is it really in bulk anything more than a mass of prejudice and conceit , cynical indulgence , and a hard suspicion of and hostility to the expropriated classes in the community ?
I remember sitting in one of the recesses at the end of the big saloon with Mrs. Redmondson , one of those sharp-minded , beautiful rich women one meets so often in London , who seem to have done nothing and to be capable of everything , and we watched the crowd -- uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball -- and exchanged information .
`` I do n't see things in the same way . ''
To go into a study to think about statecraft is to turn your back on the realities you are constantly needing to feel and test and sound if your thinking is to remain vital ; to choose an aim and pursue it in despite of all subsequent questionings is to bury the talent of your mind .
It is no use dealing with the intricate as though it were simple , to leap haphazard at the first course of action that presents itself ; the whole world of politicians is far too like a man who snatches a poker to a failing watch .
You KNOW it . ''
Benham had come up from his father 's preparatory school at Seagate .
Several times White had seen him excited , and when he was excited Benham was capable of tensely daring things .
On one occasion he had insisted upon walking across a field in which was an aggressive bull .
It had been put there to prevent the boys taking a short cut to the swimming place .
Then he had sat on the fence and declared his intention of always crossing the field so long as the bull remained there .
But I know his choice .
Perhaps it will bear the strain ... .
It will be a wrench , old man -- God knows . ''
Sir Godfrey had returned to London and the inmost aspect of his fellow-creatures , but the party of three was supplemented by a vague young lady from the village and an alert agent from the neighbouring Tentington estate who had intentions about a cottage .
`` Of course , '' said Benham , `` it was n't a fair sample afternoon . ''
Once she had seemed to lead the talk deliberately to money matters .
About one o'clock in the morning he found himself walking back to Finacue Street .
He was no longer a fretful conflict of nerves , but if anything he was less happy than he had been before .
On his left knee his left hand rested with two fingers held up .
He had almost forgotten her share in these problems .
And this April night air had a knife edge .
Or did this wind come from Russia ?
He was n't quite clear just how he was oriented , he had turned about so much .
She awaited his explanations .
In the background of his mind and less subdued than its importance could seem to warrant was his promise to bring the Wilder-Morris people into relations with Lady Marayne .
`` And then you will go off round the world , you will see the Tropics , you will see India , you will go into Chinese cities all hung with vermilion , you will climb mountains .
Never in my life have I seen a mountain .
It was a little after sunrise one bright morning in September that Benham came up on to the deck of the sturdy Austrian steamboat that was churning its way with a sedulous deliberation from Spalato to Cattaro , and lit himself a cigarette and seated himself upon a deck chair .
`` In Piedimulera pagero , '' said Benham over his shoulder and brought the whip across the white outstanding ribs .
`` Get up ! ''
The extra horse involved the addition of its owner , a small suspicious Latin Christian , to the company , and of another horse for him and an ugly almost hairless boy attendant .
Moreover the British consul prevailed with Benham to accept the services of a picturesque Arnaut CAVASSE , complete with a rifle , knives , and other implements and the name of Giorgio .
`` One marvels that no one comes to clear up this country , one itches to be at the job , and then one realizes that before one can begin here , one must get to work back there , where the fools and pedants of WELT POLITIK scheme mischief one against another .
Every division is subdivided .
One fool stands up for the Catholic Albanians , another finds heroes in the Servians , another talks of Brave Little Montenegro , or the Sturdy Bulgarian , or the Heroic Turk .
And here am I -- who have the light -- WANDERING !
The goatherd , reclining under the shadow of a rock , awaited Benham's embarrassment with an indolent malice .
`` So do I . ''
`` Who is the beautiful young woman who is seeing visions ? ''
`` I do n't trouble if YOU are late , '' said Prothero , sitting up in his bed with a red resentful face and crumpled hair .
`` You were with a lady . ''
Sir Philip suddenly got out of the picture even as Benham had foreseen .
He left a record of that moment of realization .
`` Where IS your friend ? ''
For three days that fight developed round the mystery of Prothero's disappearance .
Was there ever an absurder combination ?
What is the good of a social order in which the men at the top are commoner , meaner stuff than the men underneath , the same stuff , just spoilt , spoilt by prosperity and opportunity and the conceit that comes with advantage ?
This trouble wants so little , just a touch of aristocracy , just a little cultivated magnanimity , just an inkling of responsibility , and the place might rise instantly out of all this squalor and evil temper ... .
On one side unintelligent greed , unintelligent resentment on the other ; suspicion everywhere ... .
`` That 's good , '' I said , with a laugh .
But he warned me .
`` Locked himself in yesterday morning and 'as n't let any one in since , sir .
And then , of course , I understood .
Their air in dealing with this marvel was ostensibly critical and sceptical , but I could see a considerable amount of belief showing through their guarded qualifications .
The unanimity of vague belief that surrounded me was rather impressive ; I felt there must surely be SOMETHING at the root of so much conviction , and the already pretty keen curiosity I felt about the real facts of the case was distinctly whetted .
If these real facts were to be got from any one , they were to be got from Skelmersdale himself ; and I set myself , therefore , still more assiduously to efface the first bad impression I had made and win his confidence to the pitch of voluntary speech .
In due course , he accepted the proposal of a pipe and whisky in my rooms readily enough , and there , scenting by some happy instinct that there was trouble of the heart in this , and knowing that confidences beget confidences , I plied him with much of interest and suggestion from my real and fictitious past .
And it was after the third whisky of the third visit of that sort , if I remember rightly , that a propos of some artless expansion of a little affair that had touched and left me in my teens , that he did at last , of his own free will and motion , break the ice .
It 's just that that 's so rum .
`` He had dropped his hands and stopped his booing , and there he stood , abashed and awkward , the ghost of a weak , silly , aimless young man .
'I'm haunting , ' he said .
That indeed was the great difficulty -- making them understand my wishes .
I could n't let myself down by talking their lingo badly -- even if I'd been able to speak at all -- and I could n't go flapping a lot of gestures at them .
Every night before the dawn I used to march out in full rig and go off to a place where I could see the channel in which the Ocean Pioneer lay sunk , and once even , one moonlight night , I tried to walk out to her , but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me .
I saw the Albany and Piccadilly and Regent Street and all the rooms and places in the houses , very minute and very bright and distinct , spread out below me like a little city seen from a balloon .
The thing that astonished me most , and which astonishes me still , is that I saw quite distinctly the insides of the houses as well as the streets , saw little people dining and talking in the private houses , men and women dining , playing billiards , and drinking in restaurants and hotels , and several places of entertainment crammed with people .
And there was something in her , an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity , that made a strenuous attempt at proving that Snooks was not so very bad a name after all .
`` Has any one finished number three ? ''
And she spent two laborious evenings writing letters of various sorts to Fanny , before she found a decent congratulatory vein .
`` 'Then -- I also would die . '
I started at this passing of time .
The world was so little governed that with the very coming of plenty , in the full tide of an incalculable abundance , when everything necessary to satisfy human needs and everything necessary to realise such will and purpose as existed then in human hearts was already at hand , one has still to tell of hardship , famine , anger , confusion , conflict , and incoherent suffering .
Under this tremendous dawn of power and freedom , under a sky ablaze with promise , in the very presence of science standing like some bountiful goddess over all the squat darknesses of human life , holding patiently in her strong arms , until men chose to take them , security , plenty , the solution of riddles , the key of the bravest adventures , in her very presence , and with the earnest of her gifts in court , the world was to witness such things as the squalid spectacle of the Dass-Tata patent litigation .
And he was , he tells us , a 'Modern State ' man 'by instinct ' from the beginning .
The older so-called 'classical ' education of the British pedagogues , probably the most paralysing , ineffective , and foolish routine that ever wasted human life , had already been swept out of this great institution in favour of modern methods ; and he learnt Greek and Latin as well as he had learnt German , Spanish , and French , so that he wrote and spoke them freely , and used them with an unconscious ease in his study of the foundation civilisations of the European system to which they were the key .
London , under the Visible Smoke Law , by which any production of visible smoke with or without excuse was punishable by a fine , had already ceased to be the sombre smoke-darkened city of the Victorian time ; it had been , and indeed was , constantly being rebuilt , and its main streets were already beginning to take on those characteristics that distinguished them throughout the latter half of the twentieth century .
Those traditions come from the dark ages when there was really not enough for every one , when life was a fierce struggle that might be masked but could not be escaped .
Of course this famine grabbing , this fierce dispossession of others , must follow from such a disharmony between material and training .
She seemed to be in a strange world , a soundless , ruinous world , a world of heaped broken things .
And with that she recalled Paris and the Seine and the warm , overcast evening and the beautiful , luminous organisation of the War Control ... .
'I do n't know how my speculations ended .
Above the asphodel fields the mountains climb in rocky slopes to solitudes of stone and sunlight that curve round and join that wall of cliffs in one common skyline .
This desolate and austere background contrasts very vividly with the glowing serenity of the great lake below , with the spacious view of fertile hills and roads and villages and islands to south and east , and with the hotly golden rice flats of the Val Maggia to the north .
Power after Power about the armed globe sought to anticipate attack by aggression .
China and Japan had assailed Russia and destroyed Moscow , the United States had attacked Japan , India was in anarchistic revolt with Delhi a pit of fire spouting death and flame ; the redoubtable King of the Balkans was mobilising .
By the spring of 1959 from nearly two hundred centres , and every week added to their number , roared the unquenchable crimson conflagrations of the atomic bombs , the flimsy fabric of the world 's credit had vanished , industry was completely disorganised and every city , every thickly populated area was starving or trembled on the verge of starvation .
'No , ' he said .
A swarm of consorts appeared very promptly over the westward mountains , and before the unknown aeroplane had sighted Como , it had a dozen eager attendants closing in upon it .
The king was in a feverish , irritable mood all that evening , but he made his plans nevertheless with infinite cunning .
All the while at the back of King Ferdinand Charles 's mind fretted the mystery of his vanished aeroplane .
At any moment all that power at the back of his visitor might crumble away and vanish ... .
'The winter comes on .
But if we return to our novels for our evidence of the spirit of the times it becomes evident as one reads them in their chronological order , so far as that is now ascertainable , that as one comes to the latter nineteenth and the earlier twentieth century the writers are much more acutely aware of secular change than their predecessors were .
The earlier novelists tried to show 'life as it is , ' the latter showed life as it changes .
More and more of their characters are engaged in adaptation to change or suffering from the effects of world changes .
They give us the discord between the opening egotisms of youths and the ill-defined limitations of a changing social life .
For any road in life leads to religion for those upon it who will follow it far enough ... .
But there is something in women , in many women , which responds to these provocations ; they succumb to a peculiarly self-cultivating egotism .
... ' He waved his hand towards the dark sky above the mountain crests .
Feats of legal subtlety are inopportune , arithmetical exploits still more so .
To stamp violently upon obscure newspapers nobody had heard of before and send a printer to prison , and to give thereby a flaming advertisement to the possible use of soldiers in civil conflicts and set every barrack-room talking , may be permissible , but it is certainly very ill-advised .
That is one possibility that is frequently in my thoughts about the present labour crisis .
Why should we not as a community do them ourselves ?
Why , in other words , should we not have a labour conscription and take a year or so of service from everyone in the community , high or low ?
It would be presumptuous to anticipate the National Plan that must emerge from so vast a debate , but certain conclusions I feel in my bones will stand the test of an exhaustive criticism .
The first is that a distinction will be drawn between what I would call `` interesting work '' and what I would call `` mere labour . ''
The cultivated land at least is usually assigned , temporarily or inalienably , as property to specific individuals , and the individuals are grouped in generally monogamic families of which the father is the head .
At one extreme , over large areas of thin pasture this agricultural community may verge on the nomadic ; at another , in proximity to consuming markets , it may present the concentration of intensive culture .
The law that holds this community together is largely traditional and customary and almost always as its primordial bond there is some sort of temple and some sort of priest .
Typically , the temple is devoted to a local god or a localised saint , and its position indicates the central point of the locality , its assembly place and its market .
The community may maintain itself in a state of complete isolation , but more usually there are tracks or roads to the centres of adjacent communities , and a certain drift of travel , a certain trade in non-essential things .
But since the very dawn of history at least this Normal Social Life has never been the whole complete life of mankind .
Suppose now the Sociological Society , or some considerable proportion of it , were to adopt this view , that sociology is the description of the Ideal Society and its relation to existing societies , would not this give the synthetic framework Professor Durkheim , for example , has said to be needed ?
Now , many answers are being given to that question at the present time .
This is marriage at its minimum , as the eternal indissoluble marriage is marriage at its maximum , and the only conceivable next step would be to have a marriage makeable by the oral declaration of both parties and terminable by the oral declaration of either , which would be , indeed , no marriage at all , but an encounter .
There is , I can not but suspect , in the mysterious activities that underlie life , some trade in records for these distinguished gramophones , and it is a trade conducted upon cheap and wholesale lines .

And it is nonsense from beginning to end .
Modern warfare is an insanity , not a sane business proposition .
To begin with , these things open new gulfs for expenditure ; in the end they mean possibilities of destruction beyond all precedent .
Such things as the _Zeppelin_ and the _Ville de Paris_ are only the first pigmy essays of the aeronaut .
It is clear that to be effective , capable of carrying guns and comparatively insensitive to perforation by shot and shell , these things will have to be very much larger and as costly , perhaps , as a first-class cruiser .
Two little girls bobbed and an old labourer touched his hat convulsively as I walked through the village .
He still thought he knew his place -- and mine .
The doctor in Bladesover ranked below the vicar but above the `` vet , '' artists and summer visitors squeezed in above or below this point according to their appearance and expenditure , and then in a carefully arranged scale came the tenantry , the butler and housekeeper , the village shopkeeper , the head keeper , the cook , the publican , the second keeper , the blacksmith ( whose status was complicated by his daughter keeping the post-office -- and a fine hash she used to make of telegrams too ! )
It was an invaluable remark to her ; I do not know how she would have got along without it .
I got it out of the Bladesover saloon .
We found a wood where `` Trespassing '' was forbidden , and did the `` Retreat of the Ten Thousand '' through it from end to end , cutting our way bravely through a host of nettle beds that barred our path , and not forgetting to weep and kneel when at last we emerged within sight of the High Road Sea .
Usually I took the part of that distinguished general Xenophen -- and please note the quantity of the o. I have all my classical names like that , -- Socrates rhymes with Bates for me , and except when the bleak eye of some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment , I use those dear old mispronunciations still .
The little splash into Latin made during my days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit .
Well , -- if I met those great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly adjusted I did at least meet them alive , as an equal , and in a living tongue .
She was eight , and she came with a nurse called Nannie ; and to begin with , I did not like her at all .
But you 're not .
YOU 'RE being done -- in a sense .
Take a hundred-to one chance , or one to a hundred -- what does it matter ?
At the first glance I judged my aunt was plumper than she had been , but her complexion was just as fresh and her China blue eye as bright as in the old days .
`` By Jove ! ''
No doubt he needed me , -- I was , I will admit , his indispensable right hand ; but his was the brain to conceive .
`` Many people who are MODERATELY well think they are QUITE well , '' was one of his early efforts .

The Beaver is a dreamy fool , I 'll admit , him and his dams , but after all there 's a sort of protection about 'em , a kind of muddy practicality !
By that time I was twenty-four .
She was young and extraordinarily conventional -- she seemed never to have an idea of her own but always the idea of her class -- and I was young and sceptical , enterprising and passionate ; the two links that held us together were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for me , and her appreciation of her importance in my thoughts .
In her I had discovered woman desired .
She was a thin , bright-eyed , hawk-nosed girl of thirtyodd , with prominent teeth , a high-pitched , eager voice and a disposition to be urgently smart in her dress .
Her hats were startling and various , but invariably disconcerting , and she talked in a rapid , nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty , and broken by little screams of `` Oh , my dear ! ''
and `` you never did ! ''
It was one of the intense minor irritations of my married life that Smithie 's whirlwind chatter seemed to me to have far more influence with Marion than anything I had to say .
Effie , restless little cockney that she was , rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below , gathering flowers , discovering flowers she had never seen before .
I remember , a letter from Marion in my pocket .
I had even made some tentatives for return , for a reconciliation ; Heaven knows now how I had put it !
But what was possible ?
I could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all .
Young men again were here of various social origins , young Americans , treasonable clerks from other concerns , university young men , keen-looking , most of them , resolute , reserved , but on a sort of hair trigger , ready at any moment to be most voluble , most persuasive .
`` I always feel , '' said the pensive little woman , `` that there 's something about a dog -- A cat has n't got it . ''

And when at last I did it it was horrible -- for ten seconds .

My sensations of terror swooped to a climax .
And then , you know , they ended !
`` I asked you not to talk now .

I wrote back a love letter -- my first love letter -- and she made no reply for eight days .
Then came a scrawl : `` I ca n't write letters .

It was n't fair .
Life and Death -- great serious things -- why could n't they leave him alone , and his lies and ways ?
We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach , past Fulham and Hurlingham , past the long stretches of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea , round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge , and Westminster opened before us .
Moreover , there will be little to prevent a widening of the existing side walks , and the protection of the passengers from rain and hot sun by awnings , or such arcades as distinguish Turin , or Sir F. Bramwell 's upper footpaths on the model of the Chester rows .
Moreover , there is no reason but the existing filth why the roadways should not have translucent _velaria_ to pull over in bright sunshine and wet weather .
It will be the business of this chapter to discuss the relation between the social order and the available means of transit , and to attempt to deduce from the principles elucidated the coming phases in that extraordinary expansion , shifting and internal redistribution of population that has been so conspicuous during the last hundred years .
For a time neither of these inventions was applied to the needs of intra-urban transit at all .
For a time they were purely centripetal forces .
They worked simply to increase the general volume of trade , to increase , that is , the pressure of population upon the urban centres .
Hitherto the only borrower had been the farmer , then the exploring trader had found a world too wide for purely individual effort , and then suddenly the craftsmen of all sorts and the carriers discovered the need of the new , great , wholesale , initially expensive appliances that invention was offering them .
It was the development of mechanism that created the great bulk of modern shareholding , it took its present shape distinctively only with the appearance of the railways .
The literary `` Boom , '' for example , affected the entire reading public of the early nineteenth century .
It was no figure of speech that `` everyone '' was reading Byron or puzzling about the Waverley mystery , that first and most successful use of the unknown author dodge .
But the factory-syren voice of the modern `` boomster '' touches whole sections of the reading public no more than fog-horns going down Channel .
One gets used to literary booms just as one gets used to motor cars , they are no longer marvellous , universally significant things , but merely something that goes by with much unnecessary noise and leaves a faint offence in the air .
They live safely in their islands ; a little while ago they could not have lived at all , or could have lived only on the shameful bread of patronage , and yet it is these very men who are often most covetously bitter against the vulgar preferences of the present day .
Its westward port may be Bordeaux or Milford Haven , or even some port in the south-west of Ireland -- unless , which is very unlikely , the velocity of secure sea-travel can be increased beyond that of land locomotion .
Almost inevitably with travel , with transport communications , with every condition of human convenience insisting upon it , formally or informally a bi-lingual compromise will come into operation , and to my mind at least the chances seem even that French will emerge on the upper hand .
Unless , indeed , that great renascence of the English-speaking peoples should , after all , so overwhelmingly occur as to force this European city to be tri-lingual , and prepare the way by which the whole world may at last speak together in one tongue .
To do the latter is to do the former ; the two things are inseparable .
And the method that nature has followed hitherto in the shaping of the world , whereby weakness was prevented from propagating weakness , and cowardice and feebleness were saved from the accomplishment of their desires , the method that has only one alternative , the method that must in some cases still be called in to the help of man , is death .
There was a pause .
The young lady busied herself with her eye .
He knew there was no fly .
He would have mumbled some sort of apology ; but the other man in brown gave him no time , turned on him abruptly , even fiercely .
What might not be happening to her now ?
He thought again of her tears .
Surely it was merely his duty , seeing the trouble afoot , to keep his eye upon it .
`` This way , then , '' said the other man in brown , and they walked slowly down the North Street towards the Grammar School .
There was , perhaps , thirty seconds ' silence .
`` Go , '' she whispered , without glancing round .
He stood looking at her for a moment , with a strange light in his eyes .
`` I have you in my hand , '' he said , `` in my power .
This time Bechamel was really startled .
Denison , Denison , Denison .
`` But what IS your name ? ''
`` What 's up with YOU ? ''
The two small boys failed to understand .
said the fair young man in the white tie .
`` And -- Madam ? ''
For seven consecutive days of the year , at least , each man or woman under the Rule must go right out of all the life of men into some wild and solitary place , must speak to no man or woman and have no sort of intercourse with mankind .
Provision must be taken for the period of the journey , a rug or sleeping sack -- for they must sleep under the open sky -- but no means of making a fire .
They must not go by beaten ways or wherever there are inhabited houses , but into the bare , quiet places of the globe -- the regions set apart for them .
Indeed our individual friends and enemies stand between us and hide or interpret for us all the larger things .
We must feel others , and those not strangers , kneeling beside us .
Love will stir imaginations that have never stirred before .
I have put out two ideas of unification and self-devotion , extremes upon a scale one from another ; one of these ideas is that devotion to the Purpose in things I have called Salvation ; the other that devotion to some other most fitting and satisfying individual which is passionate love , the former extensive as the universe , the latter the intensest thing in life .
He set himself to whistle a peculiarly penetrating arrangement of three notes supposed by the boys of the Hastings Academy and himself and Sid Pornick , for no earthly reason whatever , to be the original Huron war-cry .
Then he fell a-thinking .
He resolved that , come what might , when he came back to New Romney at Christmas , he would by hook or by crook kiss Ann .
Mr. Shalford , after a brave stand for what he called `` Innyvishal lib'ty '' and the `` Idea of my System , '' a stand which he explained he made chiefly on patriotic grounds , was at last , under pressure of certain of his customers , compelled to fall in line with the rest of the local Early Closing Association , and Mr. Kipps could emerge in daylight and go where he listed for long , long hours .
Then he turned as rapidly to Kipps again , who was now stooping down , pursuing the tale of his injuries .
He raised himself into a sitting position under Chitterlow 's urgent encouragement .
It 's the very best pick-me-up there is .
You trust me , Rodgers .
I never take no other and I do n't advise you to .
Kipps lay still for a long time , then blew profoundly , turned over and stared at the other side of the dark .
The whole room was flooded with warm , golden sunshine .
Twelve 'Undred a Year .
Twelve 'UNDRED a Year !
It was in the Public Library that he came upon Kipps .
The conversation hung for a moment .
`` D'ju smoke ? ''
And there was a letter from old Kipps saying it was difficult to leave the shop and come over and see him again just yet , but that he had been to a sale at Lydd the previous day and bought a few good old books and things it would be difficult to find the equal of in Folkestone .
`` They do n't know the value of these things out here , '' wrote old Kipps , `` but you may depend upon it they are valuable , '' and a brief financial statement followed .
`` There is an engraving someone might come along and offer you a lot of money for one of these days .
A queer little maid , with a big cap , admitted Kipps and took him through a bead curtain and a door into a little drawing-room , with a black and gold piano , a glazed bookcase , a Moorish cosy corner and a draped looking glass over-mantel bright with Regent Street ornaments and photographs of various intellectual lights .
At the end of the room facing the light was a portrait that struck Kipps at first as being Coote in spectacles and feminine costume and that he afterwards decided must be Coote 's mother .
Then the original appeared and he discovered that it was Coote 's elder and only sister who kept house for him .
`` I should think you could do anything if you wanted to , '' said Kipps .
She threw out her hands in disavowal .
It all became possible by the Walshinghams -- it would seem at Coote's instigation -- deciding , after all , not to spend the holidays at Bruges .
`` You mean -- -- '' he said ; and then , `` do n't you hold me cheap ? ''
The next morning found him dressing with a certain quiet severity of movement , and it seemed to his landlady 's housemaid that he was unusually dignified at breakfast .
He was going to New Romney to tell the old people what had happened and where he stood .
And the love of Helen had also given him courage to do what Buggins had once suggested to him as a thing he would do were he in Kipps ' place , and that was to hire a motor car for the afternoon .
He had an early cold lunch , and then , with an air of quiet resolution , assumed a cap and coat he had purchased to this end , and thus equipped strolled around , blowing slightly , to the motor shop .
At the outset of Kipps ' great fortunes there had been much talk of some permanent provision for them .
Kipps had pictured an ideal cottage , with a creeper always in exuberant flower about the door , where the sun shone forever and the wind never blew and a perpetual welcome hovered in the doorway .
Kipps got his word in at last .
`` I wonder what you will do with all that money , '' he speculated .
You should hear Masterman .
It 's no good giving it back to the state as things are .
`` 'Ow about it ? ''
That 's all coming ... . ''
`` I kep ' a chair for you , '' said Kipps and removed a guardian foot .
`` And you found that you could n't .
There he did get what for a time he held to be a point in his favour .
`` The last girl .
You _got_ to marry me , Ann . ''
Ann shook her head .
You ca n't be engaged to me . ''
`` Here 's to Hope ! ''
he said , `` The Light of the World ! ''
`` O v e r a f o u s a n d p o u n d s ! ''
Or , again , you figure Kipps with something of the air of a young sacristan , handling his brightly virginal account-books , and looking , and looking again , and then still looking , at an unparalleled specimen of copperplate engraving , ruled money below and above , bearing the words `` In Account with , ARTHUR KIPPS '' ( loud flourishes ) , `` The Booksellers' Trading Union '' ( temperate decoration ) .
You figure Ann sitting and stitching at one point of the circumference of the light of the lamp , stitching queer little garments for some unknown stranger , and over against her sits Kipps .
At intervals he brings down this latter with great care and emphasis upon the paper , and when he lifts it there appears a beautiful oval design of which `` Paid , Arthur Kipps , The Associated Booksellers ' Trading Union , '' and a date , are the essential ingredients , stamped in purple ink .
Oh , old Kipps ! ''
and somehow he managed to mix a chuckle and a sob in the most remarkable way .
`` I reely do n't think I was thinking of anything , '' he said at last with a smile .
The growling overhead was renewed , so suddenly and with so much savage anger that it startled me .
He lifted me as though I was a little child .
`` It is even so , '' said one of the beasts in the doorway .
At last I roused myself from my inaction , and turning seaward walked straight into the water .
Sometimes I rise above my level , sometimes I fall below it ; but always I fall short of the things I dream .
The human shape I can get now , almost with ease , so that it is lithe and graceful , or thick and strong ; but often there is trouble with the hands and the claws , -- painful things , that I dare not shape too freely .
These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon as you began to observe them ; but to me , just after I make them , they seem to be indisputably human beings .
Men have been a hundred thousand in the making . ''
This puma of mine -- '' After a silence , `` And they revert .
As soon as my hand is taken from them the beast begins to creep back , begins to assert itself again . ''
And he got up , and went for the brandy .
he said returning , `` you logic-chopping , chalky-faced saint of an atheist , drink ! ''
I saw the curving charge of the flames across the sloping straw .
I went back to the beach , and turning eastward past the burning enclosure , made for a point where a shallow spit of coral sand ran out towards the reef .
It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these monsters , -- to tell how , day by day , the human semblance left them ; how they gave up bandagings and wrappings , abandoned at last every stitch of clothing ; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs ; how their foreheads fell away and their faces projected ; how the quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some of them in the first month of my loneliness became a shuddering horror to recall .
And so , in hope and solitude , my story ends .
He was , he explained , a student of philology preparing for his doctorate .
He was studying the dialects of East Anglia --
Then Mr. Direck fell into the hands of Hugh , the eldest son , and anticipating the inevitable , said that he liked to walk in the rose garden .
From this his head and neck projected , he felt , with a tolerable dignity .
Teddy suggested a fillet of green ribbon , and this Mr. Direck tried , but after prolonged reflection before the glass rejected .
Or is it wise , and merely refusing to pamper us ?
But if the whole thing is cruel , perhaps also it is witless and will-less ?
He was ready enough to blame others -- dons , politicians , public apathy , but what was he himself doing ?
`` But what should we do ? ''
It do seem to be beginning like . ''
So far as he could judge he had strayed right into Suffolk ... .
`` I wonder what will happen to Albania ? ''
She may have been born with it ; it is on record that at the age of ten she was pronounced a singularly trying child .
As a boy , he had enjoyed her confidences -- about other people and the general neglect of her advice .
She was sometimes kind , she was frequently absurd ... .
With very little children she was quite wise and Jolly ... .
`` What is a man of my sort to do ? ''
asked a clean-shaven barrister .
They had lived in an atmosphere of comedy , and denied in the whole tenor of their lives that life is tragic .
Not even the Americans had been more isolated .
Even Ireland was away -- a four-hour crossing .
Ultimately everything would turn out all right .
They produced horrible strains in his mind .
Here and there some weak-minded officer may have sought to make himself terrible ... .
And as for the bombardment of cathedrals and the crime of Louvain , well , Mr. Britling was prepared to argue that Gothic architecture is not sacrosanct if military necessity cuts through it ... .
`` Your nephew Hugh . ''
More than one German on the bayonet at a time is an incumbrance .
`` I do n't like his going , '' he said .
`` I hope it will be all right with him ... .
Mr. Britling returned to the Dower House perplexed and profoundly disturbed .
`` It 's been just the last straw of all this hellish foolery ... .
Teddy had been listed now as `` missing , since reported killed , '' and she had had two letters from his comrades .
They said Teddy had been left behind in the ruins of a farm with one or two other wounded , and that when the Canadians retook the place these wounded had all been found butchered .
Afterwards the Canadians had had to fall back .
Only one of his witnesses was quite clear about Teddy , but he , alas !
There had been only one lieutenant among the men left behind , he said , and obviously that must have been Teddy .
`` You think I go about staring at nothing , '' she remarked ... .
She resumed her excavation with the little stick , with the tears running down her face .
Letty came through the little wood and over the stile that brought her into sight of the cottage .
The crimson rambler over the porch that she and Teddy had planted was still bearing roses .
The door was open and people were moving in the porch .
There was a time in the earlier part of this war when it was hard to be patient because there hung over us the dread of losses and disaster .
Now we need dread no longer .
Sitting together as we do in spirit beside the mangled bodies of our dead , surely we can be as patient as the hills._
They were very angry .
Because he was a bishop and because really he did not believe fully and completely in the Trinity .
At one and the same time he did not believe in the Trinity and was terrified by the anger of the Trinity at his unbelief ... .
`` A little party but it wo n't put you out send your man with your change . ''
`` If there was something else , an alternative , another religion , another Church , to which one could go , the whole case would be different .
But he promised that the next time they met in the club he would go into the matter `` exhausteevely . ''
`` And the truth ? ''
The Bishop of Princhester reflected .
But he said at last : `` I believe there is a God and that he is as real a person as you or I .
And he is not the theological God we set out before the world . ''
Lady Ella met him with affection and solicitude .
`` You 've come to see me ? ''
`` Youa husband 's views , '' she said , `` we'e a 'eal 'evelation to me .
It was like not being blind -- all at once . ''
The great Angel seemed still to be near at hand , limitless space was all about him , and yet the bishop perceived that he was now sitting in the arm-chair in his bedroom in the palace of Princhester .
It seemed now as if he had two distinct yet kindred selves , and that the former watched the latter .
`` It is a drug , '' she answered .
she cried , `` why have you done this ?
I know you have been sleepless , but I have been so ready to help you .
My life is all to be of use to you ... . ''
The congregation answered doubtfully , with a glance at its prayer books : `` Who hath made heaven and earth . ''
Whippham thrust forward a chair for the bishop to sit down .
`` My dear Scrope , '' he wrote , `` your explanation explains nothing .
This sensational declaration of infidelity to our mother church , made under the most damning and distressing circumstances in the presence of young and tender minds entrusted to your ministrations , and in defiance of the honourable engagements implied in the confirmation service , confirms my worst apprehensions of the weaknesses of your character .
I have always felt the touch of theatricality in your temperament , the peculiar craving to be pseudo-deeper , pseudo-simpler than us all , the need of personal excitement .
You wanted to be taken notice of -- personally .
`` My dear Sir , '' he said .
`` How can you expect me to help you to a drug so disastrous ?
-- even if I could tell you what it is . ''
Nor did he attach sufficient importance to Lady Sunderbund 's disposition to invite Positivists , members of the Brotherhood Church , leaders among the Christian Scientists , old followers of the Rev .
Religion to him was something that illuminated the soul , to her it was something that illuminated prayer-books .
He waited in the little room with the Wyndham Lewis picture that opened upon the balcony painted with crazy squares of livid pink .
On a golden table by the window a number of recently bought books were lying , and he went and stood over these , taking them up one after another .
For some minutes he studied the grim portrait of this inspired lady standing with one foot ostentatiously on her coronet and then turned to the next volume .
The third dealt with Madame Guyon .
It was difficult not to feel that Lady Sunderbund was reading for a part .
Scrope held his hand out .
Somehow Lady Sunderbund 's chapel was very remote and flimsy now , and the hardships of poverty seemed less black than the hardship of a youthful death .
I 've made an important decision . ''
`` But the fire ! ''
interjected Lady Ella , disposing of that idea .
It was a life hardly worth living .
That a large proportion of the people about me had no better a lot , that many had a worse , does not affect these facts .
It was a life in which contentment would have been disgraceful .
If some of them were contented or resigned , so much the worse for every one .
To the right , very clear and relatively high , the Bantock Burden pit-mouth was marked by a gaunt lattice bearing a great black wheel , very sharp and distinct in the twilight , and beyond , in an irregular perspective , were others following the lie of the seams .
The interest passes outwardly ; the men from the little rooms are going homeward , the printers disperse yawning , the roaring presses slacken .
cried the voice of Mrs. Stuart .
`` Is that you ? ''
I paused at the foot of the stairs , expecting her to appear and come down .
There were no more vague intentions swaying me this way and that ; I was perfectly clear now upon what I meant to do .
As I sat down in his leather-covered armchair , I had an odd memory of the one in the Clayton dentist 's operating-room -- I know not why .
I felt extraordinarily cool and capable , exhilarated , if anything , by this prompt , effectual theft .
After all , my great determination would achieve itself .
I had argued away all anxiety before I reached Clayton Crest .
This place , upon which I had at last happened , was a fruit of the reaction of artistic-minded and carelessly living people against the costly and uncomfortable social stiffness of the more formal seaside resorts of that time .
It was , you must understand , the custom of the steam-railway companies to sell their carriages after they had been obsolete for a sufficient length of years , and some genius had hit upon the possibility of turning these into little habitable cabins for the summer holiday .
The thing had become a fashion with a certain Bohemian-spirited class ; they added cabin to cabin , and these little improvised homes , gaily painted and with broad verandas and supplementary leantos added to their accommodation , made the brightest contrast conceivable to the dull rigidities of the decorous resorts .
Of course there were many discomforts in such camping that had to be faced cheerfully , and so this broad sandy beach was sacred to high spirits and the young .
But so far as I was concerned this odd settlement of pleasure-squatters was a mystery as well as a surprise , enhanced rather than mitigated by an imaginative suggestion or so I had received from the wooden-legged man at Shaphambury .
Once more I stumbled .
There was something about my feet that impeded me , tall grass or heather , but I could not see what it was , only this smoke that eddied about my knees .
Everything grew darker and darker .
He added in explanation , `` Then there would n't have been such stories as yours at all , you know .
A wonderful thing that must have seemed , had any man had by chance the power of resistance to the vapor , and could he have walked amidst it .
AND what a strange unprecedented thing was that cabinet council at which I was present , the council that was held two days later in Melmount 's bungalow , and which convened the conference to frame the constitution of the World State .
I was there because it was convenient for me to stay with Melmount .
I had nowhere to go particularly , and there was no one at his bungalow , to which his broken ankle confined him , but a secretary and a valet to help him to begin his share of the enormous labors that evidently lay before the rulers of the world .
Every message had to be taken to the village post-office in that grocer 's shop at Menton , half a mile away .
At that time his room seemed to me the most beautifully furnished in the world , and I could identify now the vivid cheerfulness of the chintz of the sofa on which the great statesman lay just in front of me , the fine rich paper , the red sealing-wax , the silver equipage of the desk I used .
In the old days everybody was always keeping something back from somebody , being wary and cunning , prevaricating , misleading -- for the most part for no reason at all .
I remember that went on through all our talk .
She put those ragged crimson shreds in a long row and adjusted them and readjusted them .
She spoke no longer to me but to herself .
Then , I really must insist that young men do not understand the real truth about accomplishments .
Young men are so full of poetry and emotion that it does not occur to them how widely the sordid vices are distributed in the other sex .
You are always getting swept and garnished , straightened up and sent out to be shaved .
And home -- even your study -- becomes a glittering , spick-and-span mechanism .
But you know the parable of the seven devils ?
The next chapter is headed `` In Old Madrid , '' and Di Sorno , cloaked to conceal his grandeur , `` moves sad and observant among the giddy throng . ''
`` In a moment he had flung himself headlong down among the flashing blades of the toreadors and the trampling confusion of bulls , and in another he stood before her , bowing low with the recovered flowers in his hand .
'' A very proper remark .
And that brings us to the central thing of the Blade 's life , the eternal Feminine !
They must e'en sit and palpitate while the Blade flashes .
Every Blade has his secrets and mysteries in this matter -- remorse even for crimes .
Even he does not know .
the reckless protestations of love he has made , the broken promises , the broken hearts !
My old cricketer was seized , he says , some score of years ago now , by sciatica , clutched indeed about the loins thereby , and forcibly withdrawn from the practice of the art ; since when a certain predisposition to a corpulent habit has lacked its natural check of exercise , and a broadness almost Dutch has won upon him .
Far be it from me to sing her praises , but I must admit that at times she is extremely successful in this -- at times almost too successful .
You see these people , and lots of other people , too , believe in a thing they call Natural Selection .
I see no reason why he should not have kept his hair on .
A thick covering of hair , like that of a Capuchin monkey , would be an invaluable protection against sudden changes of temperature , far better than any clothing can be .
And in the past , when clothing was less perfect and firing a casual commodity , the disadvantages of losing hair were all the greater .
You can not walk six miles anywhere along the south coast without coming upon one of these heaps of people , called a watering-place .
There will be a town of houses behind wherein the people lodge , until , as they think , they have stayed a sufficient time at the sea , and they return , hot , cross , and mystified , to London .
The sea front will be bricked or paved for a mile or so , and there will be rows of boats and bathing-machines , and other contrivances to screen off the view of the sea .
He is born good , a congenital good example , a sufferer from atrophy of his original sin .
The only hope I can see for Bagarrow , short of murder , is forcible trepanning .
It may be he might prove a very decent fellow then -- if there was anything left of him , that is .
It is curious to think that , were the moon but a little brighter and truly the ruler of the night , rising to its empire with the setting of the sun , we should never dream of the great stellar universe in which our little solar system swims -- or know it only as a traveller 's tale , a strange thing to be seen at times in the Arctic Circle .
By a mere accident of our existence we see their multitude ever and again , when the curtains of the daylight and moonlight , and of our own narrow pressing necessities , are for a little while drawn back .
But it happens that we have it .
Nowadays we do not bring the sweet egotisms , the vivid beautiful personal intensities of childhood , into the cold , vast presence of death .
I would as soon , my dear , have sent your busy little limbs toiling up the Matterhorn .
`` But suppose you ca n't , '' I must have urged .
This is the reality of laws and government ; this is the reality of customs and institutions ; _a convention between jealousies_ .
There were few novels in my father 's house and I neither saw nor read any plays until I was near manhood , so that I thought naturally about love and not rather artificially round and about love as so many imaginative young people are trained to do .
These earliest experiences rarely got beyond a sort of dumb awe , a vague , vast , ineffectual desire for self-immolation .
For a time I remember I worshipped Lady Ladislaw with all my being .
I spread my adoration at her feet , fresh and frank .
I begged hard , but there was someone called Auntie who had to be considered , an Atropos for that thread of romance .
And afterwards I would spend long hours in recalling and analyzing those nothings , questioning their nothingness , making out of things too submerged and impalpable for the rough drags of recollection , promises and indications .
Afterwards as she moved about she gave me other instructions , and for the most part I wrote to her in envelopes addressed for her by one of the Fawney girls , who was under her spell and made no enquiry for what purpose these envelopes were needed .
It was the crown of all my soldiering .
We treat this seniority as though it were a virile characteristic ; we treat the man as though he were a natural senior , we expect a weakness , a timid deference , in the girl .
I do not remember that there was any corresponding intention in my mind to be hers .
And I was artificial in all my attitudes to her , I thought of what would interest her , what would please her , I knew from the outset that what she saw in me to rouse that deep , shy glow of exaltation in her face was illusion , illusion it was my business to sustain .
And so I won her , and long years had to pass , years of secret loneliness and hidden feelings , of preposterous pretences and covert perplexities , before we escaped from that crippling tradition of inequality and looked into one another 's eyes with understanding and forgiveness , a woman and a man .
It is your mother 's birthday , and you three children have gone with her and Mademoiselle Potin into the forest to celebrate the occasion .
I have gathered since that after I left Martens he sent telegrams to Guy and Philip and her cousin Lord Tarvrille .
`` I see Stratton , yes , I see .
no , I wo n't have a cigarette . ''
Damn it , Tarvrille ! ''
`` Let _her_ send me away .
Three nights after when I was in bed I became very lucidly awake -- it must have been about two or three in the morning -- and the vision of life returned to me , with that same effect of enlargement and illumination .
It bade me rouse my spirit and go on with the thoughts and purposes that had been stirring and proliferating in my mind when I had returned to England from the Cape .
No matter , the stillness answered , in the end all that is just to temper you for your greater uses ... .
I can not forget , I insisted .
But Mary , I urged , to forget Mary is a treason , an ingratitude , seeing that she loved me .
But the stillness did not command me to forget her , but only to turn my face now to the great work that lies before mankind .
I question myself constantly whether this life we live to-day , whether that too , is more than a trial of these blind constructive forces , more universal perhaps , more powerful perhaps than any predecessor but still a trial , to litter the world with rusting material when the phase of recession recurs .
She finished what she had to do with that and then remarked , `` I thought you two were not to correspond . ''
So it has always been with me and always , I suppose , will be .
God , I suppose , has a need for lame men .
But so it is with me , and this is the innermost secret I have to tell you .
`` I did n't know she was in the hotel until the next day . ''
Then she moved her arm as though she felt for me blindly , and I put my arms about her and drew her head to my shoulder and she wept ... .
`` My God ! ''
`` Why do you torment me ?
Have n't I thought enough of those things ?
The thing will pursue us all , cling to us .
What do you mean to do ? ''
I became grotesquely anxious to assure him that , indeed , she and I had been , as they say , innocent throughout our last day together .
`` She kept her faith with you .
Indeed there was nothing . ''
For what seemed a long time he did not grasp the situation .
He glanced over his shoulder and understood suddenly .
He had as he picked it up seen what was written , but the situation dominated him for the instant .
He looked again , eyebrows rising .
`` Yes , '' she said surprised -- quite naturally .
`` It 's a walk not to be lost . ''
`` We may never have a chance to see one another again . ''
He began to find out , too , how little the world feels the need of a young man of nineteen -- he called himself nineteen , though he had several months of eighteen still to run -- even though he adds prizes for good conduct , general improvement , and arithmetic , and advanced certificates signed by a distinguished engineer and headed with the Royal Arms , guaranteeing his knowledge of geometrical drawing , nautical astronomy , animal physiology , physiography , inorganic chemistry , and building construction , to his youth and strength and energy .
`` I can assure you , '' he would write , `` that you will find me a loyal and devoted assistant . ''
Dunkerley pointed out that Bonover 's testimonial ignored the question of moral character and discipline in a marked manner , and Bonover refused to alter it .
And the talk that night was a momentous one .
`` Why have you broken your promise ? ''
She did not grasp his emotional quality .
`` That 's better , '' said Mr. Chaffery .
I ca n't stand Dissenters .
I 've a peculiar dislike to Dissenters .
To my mind it 's the great drawback of this Clapham .
I have invariably found them deceitful -- invariably . ''
Ethel re-entered without her hat and jacket , and with a noisy square black tray , a white cloth , some plates and knives and glasses , and began to lay the table .
`` Wait till I 've done with it , '' said Chaffery with a certain zest .
`` Of course it 's imperative you should understand my position .
Ever since I read your letter I 've been thinking over that .
A sort of prophet .
`` Ethel is yours , '' he repeated after an interval and added pensively -- '' to keep . ''
Ethel was also of opinion that much might be learnt from the sixpenny ladies ' papers -- the penny ones had hardly begun in those days .
She had bought such publications during seasons of affluence , but chiefly , as she now deplored , with an eye to the trimming of hats and such like vanities .
It 'll be hard enough to get you anything without that . ''
The sort of schoolmaster we deal with ca n't find anything out .
He ca n't teach any of these things himself -- and consequently he does n't believe they _can_ be taught .
Talk to him of pedagogics and he talks of practical experience .
But he puts 'em on his prospectus , you know , and he wants 'em on his time-table .
What _is_ commercial geography ? ''
Thence he went to the College of Pedagogues in Holborn .
The 'ologies and 'ographies were taken down with polite surprise at their number .
`` You ought to take one of our diplomas , '' said the stout man .
`` You would find no difficulty .
And there are prizes -- several prizes -- in money . ''
You perceive him , a lank , cadaverous , good-looking man with long black hair and a semi-clerical costume of quite painful rustiness .
His grocer looked at it suspiciously .
`` You pay it in , '' said Mr. Lucas Holderness , `` if you 've any doubts about it .
_I_ ca n't answer for him .
It was moonlight and a hillside , the little town lay lit and warm below , and the scene was set to music , a lugubriously sentimental air .
`` There 's nothing wrong here , '' he said , and handed the book to Lewisham .
Her face was flushed , her eyes downcast .
She knitted her brows .
His thoughts went to his Socialism , to his red-hot ambition of world mending .
He marvelled at the vistas he had discovered since those days .
But it is good for awhile to be free from the carping note that must needs be audible when we discuss our present imperfections , to release ourselves from practical difficulties and the tangle of ways and means .
By the time he gets to this part of his story we have , at my initiative , left the bridge and are walking towards the Utopian guest house .
`` Good-night , '' two sweet-voiced Utopians cry to us in their universal tongue , and I answer them `` Good-night . ''
It will , of course , be an aggravation of , and not an excuse for , crime .
Upon such quicksands rose an edifice that aped the securities of material science , developed a technical jargon and professed the discovery of `` laws . ''
Modern Economics differs mainly from old Political Economy in having produced no Adam Smith .
The old `` Political Economy '' made certain generalisations , and they were mostly wrong ; new Economics evades generalisations , and seems to lack the intellectual power to make them .
The science hangs like a gathering fog in a valley , a fog which begins nowhere and goes nowhere , an incidental , unmeaning inconvenience to passers-by .
We tried to check him with questions at this most illuminating point , but he drove on like a torrent , and carried his topic out of sight .
He talked of the overmanagement of the world , and among other things of the laws that would not let a poor simple idiot , a `` natural , '' go at large .
`` We make all these distinctions between man and man , we exalt this and favour that , and degrade and seclude that ; we make birth artificial , life artificial , death artificial . ''
`` You _are_ those individuals . ''
Our position is unfortunate for me .
we shall ask a uniformed fellow Utopian .
Finally , with a bold disregard of the logician 's classificatory rules , these Utopian statesmen who devised the World State , hewed out in theory a class of the Base .
The Base may , indeed , be either poietic , kinetic , or dull , though most commonly they are the last , and their definition concerns not so much the quality of their imagination as a certain bias in it , that to a statesman makes it a matter for special attention .
`` That makes it fair .
`` But , then -- where is the incentive -- -- ? ''
Our Founders organised motives from all sorts of sources , but I think the chief force to give men self-control is Pride .
Pride may not be the noblest thing in the soul , but it is the best King there , for all that .
They looked to it to keep a man clean and sound and sane .
A man must come from the table satisfied , but not replete .
I am reminded of what my double said to me of race .
A great and increasing number of people are persuaded that `` half-breeds '' are peculiarly evil creatures -- as hunchbacks and bastards were supposed to be in the middle ages .
The half-breed , one hears , combines all the vices of either parent , he is wretchedly poor in health and spirit , but vindictive , powerful , and dangerous to an extreme degree , his morals -- the mean white has high and exacting standards -- are indescribable even in whispers in a saloon , and so on , and so on .
There is really not an atom of evidence an unprejudiced mind would accept to sustain any belief of the sort .
There is , of course , a passing suggestion of Darwin 's to account for atavism that might go to support the theory of the vileness of half-breeds , if it had ever been proved .
Never had the Vicar seen such gorgeous floods of colour , not stained glass windows , not the wings of butterflies , not even the glories of crystals seen between prisms , no colours on earth could compare with them .
The Angel 's beauty was too clearly the beauty of the youth .
`` But _why_ should he be about the shrubbery ... in that dreadful costume ? ''
I 'd be ashamed to come poking and peering round quiet people 's houses ... . ''
`` Goomorn ' . ''
He arrested an escaping hiccough .
At last the garment lay on the ground , and through the frequent interstices of his reminiscences of a waistcoat , the drunken tinker displayed a fine hairy and muscular body to the Angel 's observant eyes .
He squared up in masterly fashion .
But the story is plausible .
If this Mr Angel were someone very clever and eccentric -- ''
`` There he goes , '' said Mrs Jehoram , rising , `` across the cornfield .
How convenient for peeping at the Vicarage !
He is a man .
`` And hoping , '' said the Angel with a wonderful glance.
-- '' Yes . ''
She looked at him and looked again .
`` The silly creature has gone to sleep , '' she said , and though she had a heavy basket to carry , came towards him with an idea of waking him up .
But as she drew near she saw his shoulders heave and heard the sound of his sobbing .
'I _can_ get his fiddle . '
Then came this revolution in the means of locomotion , which has increased the normal range of human activity at least ten times .
The effect of that in America was opportunity ; the effect of it in Europe was congestion .
The United States was that fortunate exception .
And so far as deficiencies go , there is a great multitude of modern problems -- problems that enter intimately into the moral life of all of us , with which the Bible does not deal , the establishment of American Independence , for example , and the age-long feud of Russia and Poland that has gone on with varying fortunes for four centuries .
For these things we need at least a supplement , if we are still to keep our community upon one general basis of understanding , upon one unifying standard of thought and behaviour .
And now let us turn from the language side to the rest of schooling .
A second main division of our schooling was mathematical instruction of a sort .
It fell into the three more or less isolated subjects of arithmetic , algebra and Euclid .
We carried on in these closed cells what was , I now perceive , a needlessly laborious and needlessly muddled struggle to comprehend quantity , series and form .
That is the great primary obstacle , that is the core of our present problem .
She turned aside , and then she came to a fallen tree that she knew , with a noise of bees about it .
He caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her side .
The next afternoon , curiously enough , the very fellow of the first white rock fell , and smashed precisely according to precedent .
I like a good swaggering story before all things .
Curious times they were , with their smutty railways and puffing old iron trains , their rum little houses and their horse vehicles .
`` DOES THIS MAKE YOU GIDDY ? ''
And Denton and his Elizabeth could not flee their world , no longer were there open roads to unclaimed lands where men might live freely -- however hardly -- and keep their souls in peace .
The city had swallowed up mankind .
He had decided to show fight if any fresh indignity was offered him .
With an enormous affectation of ease he walked down the vault and entered the passage of the ash pits , only to discover he had left his jacket -- which he had taken off because of the heat of the vault -- beside his press .
He met the albino eye to eye .
The swart man reverted to his formula .
He was good enough to say he liked the look of Denton , thought he had stood up `` amazing plucky .
He sat down with an unavoidable air of sullenness .
`` Be raised up , '' he said .
But in a second that feeling vanished .
`` Let us clearly understand what a miracle is .
_By Eden Phillpotts_ Down Dartmoor Way .
He took his feet down from the mantel-board , and leant over confidentially towards me .
And the note about the New Zealand bird certainly appeared in a morning paper of unblemished reputation , for the Taxidermist keeps a copy and has shown it to me .
But the point was , one of 'em had swallowed a diamond .
`` _How did it end_ ?
He sat up stiffly and stared hard .
I wonder why he keeps sawing with his arm . ''
`` One minute , '' said the picture , evidently alarmed .
`` I want to make you an offer -- a genuine offer .
The thing might , after all , be merely a lump of that almost equally hard substance , corundum , with an accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond .
Or if it was a diamond , how came he by it , and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds ?
`` To think , '' said he , `` that I am on the verge of it all , and here !
He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps under the archway leading into Essex Street , and I let him go .
`` Thanks to _you_ . ''
Was it pure hallucination ?
He knew that such visual illusions do come as a result of mental strain .

'So long as literature thrives , Congreve must be read with growing zest , in virtue of qualities which were always rare , and which were never rarer than at this moment .
