# Sentiment Classication with Feed-Forward Neural Network Classifier

The solution is in two parts part1.ipynb and part2.py

In order to run the .ipynb file, just run the command 'ipython notebook part1.ipynb', which will open ipython notebook.

To RUN THE NOTEBOOK, go to cell and click on 'RUN ALL' which will run all the methods in the file.

Please place the .ipynb file in the same folder as that of ‘analogy’ folder and glove.6B.50d.txt, glove.6B.300d.txt, reduced_vocab.txt files.

Also attached is the python file part1.py generated from iPython notebook.

part2.py is similar to sentiment_fixed.py except with the implementation of neural networks for question 2 a.
