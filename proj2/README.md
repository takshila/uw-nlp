# POS TAGGING (HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS)

In order to run the .ipynb file, just run the command 'ipython notebook hw2.ipynb', which will open ipython notebook.

To RUN THE NOTEBOOK, go to cell and click on 'RUN ALL' which will run all the methods in the file. PLEASE NOTE that different algorithms take time for running the file. The timings are noted in the ipython notebook and can be before running the blocks.

Please place the .ipynb file in the same folder as that of twt.train.json, twt.dev.json, twt.test.json files.

Also attached is the python file generated from python notebook.

Thank you!
